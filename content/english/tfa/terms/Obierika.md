He is one of [[english/tfa/terms/Okwonko]]'s closest friends, taking care of his yams by selling them and giving the proceeds to Okwonko during his banishment. Throughout the banishment arc, he has several conversations with Okwonko over the years, discussing the state of the tribe, and trying to raise Okwonko's hopes. He is not as traditional as Okwonko, and is slightly skeptical of some of the tribe's practices.
