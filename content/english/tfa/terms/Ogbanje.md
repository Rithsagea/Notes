This word is a label for an *evil child*, who repeatedly returns to its mother, causing her to give birth to stillborns. Tribesmen suspected [[english/tfa/terms/Ezinma]] to be one of these, due to her constant illnesses. These creatures are believed to be destroyed after their *iyi-uwa* object is excavated and reburied wrapped in a cloth. Ezinma's is found and disposed of in this fashion.
