This person is the main character of the book. They pride themselves on being manly, despising their "effiminate" father, [[english/tfa/terms/Unoka]]. Throughout the course of the book, they struggle with the forces of fate, including the manslaughter of [[english/tfa/terms/Ezuedo]]'s and white settlers drastically altering his life. He is a very traditional thinker, hanging himself at the end of the book after seeing his tribe's submission to the settlers, and the rise of Christianity amongst the population.
