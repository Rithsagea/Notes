title: "Nwoye"
---
He is [[english/tfa/terms/Okwonko]]'s oldest son, possessing some character traits similar to [[english/tfa/terms/Unoka]]. This gentleness leads Okwonko to constantly beat him, until [[english/tfa/terms/Ikemefuna]]'s influence leads him to develop his own sort of masculinity, gaining a level of respect from Okwonko. He continues to struggle between masculinity and his attraction towards arts and stories. Upon [[english/tfa/terms/Ikemefuna]]'s death, his personage turns around, and he starts to scorn his father. Eventually, after the white missionaries arrive, he converts to Christianity, leaving behind his family and Okwonko and changing his name to `Isaac`. As a result, he is disowned for being "effeminate".
