title: "Mr Smith"
---
Unlike [[english/tfa/terms/Mr Brown]], Reverend James Smith is much more strict with Catholic teachings, showing zero tolerance for the Igbo people's beliefs. In following this train of thought, he encourages [[english/tfa/terms/Enoch]] to continue pushing Catholicism and supressing the natives' beliefs.
