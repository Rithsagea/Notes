title: "Nneka"

She was the first woman to convert to Christianity, spurred by her previous 4 pregnancies, which were all twins. By tradition, these "cursed" children were left to die in the [[english/tfa/terms/Umeru|Evil Forest]]. Heartbroken by the deaths of her children, she goes to Christianity so if she has another pair of twins, they will not have to die.
