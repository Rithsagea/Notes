title: "Unoka"
---
This was [[english/tfa/terms/Okwonko]]'s father, a very extroverted man who often held parties and loved to play instruments. However, he was a titleless, peaceful man, despising violence and refusing to fight. He was perpetually in debt, spending whatever money he got on palm wine. As a result, he died stooped in debt, and was despised by his son Okwonko for being weak. His influence on Okwonko was a hatred for the arts and being weak, along with a desire to be `manly`.
