This was [[english/tfa/terms/Okwonko]]'s father, a very extroverted man who often held parties and loved to play instruments. He was a very peaceful man, hating war and refusing to fight. However, he was perpetually in debt, spending whatever money he got on palm wine. As a result, he died stooped in debt, and was despised by his son Okwonko for being weak.
