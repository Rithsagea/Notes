title: "Obiageli"
---
She is the daughter of [[english/tfa/terms/Okwonko]]'s first wife. Near the beginning of the story, when all of Okwonko's children were still young, she tries to carry a pot on her head like an adult. She accidentally shatters it while trying to show off to the other children. When the adults come by, she makes up a story that she accidentally broke it. [[english/tfa/terms/Ikemefuna]] helps her by urging the children not to leak her secret.

Addendum: It is unclear whether she is Okwonko's first wife's, or [[english/tfa/terms/Ojiugo]]'s daughter. [source](https://www.answers.com/Q/Who_is_Obiageli_in_Things_Fall_Apart)
