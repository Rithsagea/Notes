The wife of Ogbuefi Udo (unimportant character) was killed in the [[english/tfa/terms/Mbaino]] market, so he and a virgin from the Mbaino village were offered as penance to [[english/tfa/terms/Umuofia]]. He stays with [[english/tfa/terms/Okwonko]] for 3 years, growing to be a dependable young man, talented in various practical skills with planting yams and making traps. Eventually, the tribe elders decide that he must be killed to settle the dispute with the neighbouring village. Okwonko takes the intiaitive to kill Ikemefuna himself, so as to fullfill his male pride. His death marks the beginning of Okwonko's overall downfall, having a lasting impact on Okwonko's psyche.
