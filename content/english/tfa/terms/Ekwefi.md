---
[[english/tfa/terms/Okwonko]]'s 2nd wife, she decided to marry him after witnessing his wrestling feats. [[english/tfa/terms/Ezinma]], her daughter, was born after 9 consecutive stillbirths, resulting in her having a particularly strong bond with Ezinma. When Ezinma gets sick, Ekwefi becomes extraordinarily worried, going so far as to ignore the curses of [[english/tfa/terms/Chielo]], following her into the hills and caves of [[english/tfa/terms/Agbala]].
