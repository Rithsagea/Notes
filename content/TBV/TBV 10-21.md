## Scientific Revolution
- Majority of Europeans saw phenomena as "God's handiwork" limited by Aristotle and Galen's frameworks
- "Natural Philosophers" used logical analysis of natural world
- Theoretical developments driven by desire to validate different schools of thought
- Much more anatomically accurate depictions; artists often called to be mathematicians
- Math in general became more prominent, being used to calculate and prove ideas and mechanisms
- Hermeticism :: Magic through mathematics, idea that world was a being, and individuals had divine spark

- Astronomy based on works of Aristotle, Claudius Ptolemey, and Christianity
- Medieval geoconcentric model :: Earth motionless sphere, circularly orbitted by 10 crystalline spheres (planets), Moon was a planet, heaven existed past the 10th sphere
	- coincided well with ideas of souls being saved in the Bible
	- model often contradicted empircal data, leading to systems of "exceptions" by astronomers
- [[Copernicus]]
	- received doctorate in canon law, which he practiced 30 years
	- studied mathematics and astronomy in a cathedral
	- realized ancient model contradicted Ptolemic model during studies
	- wrote *On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres*, published right before death due to fear
	- relied on very detailed, accurate measurements
	- proposed orbiting Earth model, attacked by Protestants
	- church only denounced ideas during rise of [[Galileo]]
- [[Tycho Brahe]]
	- spent 20 years recording movements of stars near Copenhagen
	- worked under court of Emperor Rudolf II
	- hired assistant [[Johannes Kepler]]
- [[Johannes Kepler]]
	- studied both [[Hermetic]] ideas and Neolatonic "magic"
	- succeeded [[Tycho Brahe]] after his death
	- derived laws of planetary motion through Brahe's data, supporting [[Copernicus]]' heliocentric model
	- provided 3 laws, disproving the Ptolemaic model
- [[Galileo]]
	- Italian astronomer, born of lesser noble Pisan family
	- briefly studied medicine before turning to math and astronomy
	- created the telescope, publishing detailed sketches of planets in *The Starry Messenger* (included 4 moons of Jupiter)
		- showed that heavenly bodies were not perfect spheres, rather rough stones
	- discoveries elevated status, but led to him being denounced by Inquisition
	- wrote *Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems: Ptolemaic and Copernican*; defending the heliocentric theories
	- placed under house arrest by the Inquisition
	- discovered force prop to accel and inertia
- [[Newton]]
	- invented calculus, studied light and gravity
	- received chair of mathematics at Cambridge and wrote *Principia*
		- rigorously defined mathematical concepts, to define gravity
		- defined mechanics, and explained gravitational force (empircal proof)
	- only mathematician to be buried at Westminster Abbey
	- studied a lot of alchemy and occult, still very religious (felt God was "everywhere")
