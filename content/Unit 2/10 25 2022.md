- French Phase
- Solely political motives
- Dynastic war between [[Bourbon]] and [[Hapsburg]] dynasties
- Perceived Hapsburg "exhaustion"
- [[Cardinal Richelieu]] for [[Louis XIII]]
- France won
- [[Holy Roman Empire]] loses a lot of influence
- France gains prominence
- motif for next Unit
# [[Treaty of Westphalia]]
- signed in 1648
- majority of fighting in [[Holy Roman Empire]], destroyed for around a generation
	- 1/3rd of population, cities, and farms razed
	- "Long road to recovery", like Germany in 1945
- lessons Europe learned
	- realized that religious uniformity is impossible
	- state unity > religious uniformity, similar to [[Politique|politiques]]
- new focus: [[Absolutism]] vs [[Constitutionalism]]
