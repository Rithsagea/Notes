## Magnetite
- combination of $\text{Fe}^{3+}$ and $\text{Fe}^{3+}$
- Circuit board etchant :: $\text{FeCl}_3$, $\text{FeCl}_2$, $\text{HCl}$
- Steel Wool :: $\text{Fe}$
- $2\text{FeCl}_3+\text{Fe}\rightarrow3\text{FeCl}_2$
	- exothermic, slow heat, speeds up reaction though
	- ratio Fe2 to Fe3 is important, make sure to account for changes in proportions
	- dark red Fe3 to green Fe2
	- react until the wool stops changing (~30 minutes, left overnight though)
	- may need to add more water if too much precipitant
	- coffee filter, remove precipitate
- Add Iron Nails and HCl to prevent oxidization
	- Fe2 with air oxidizes to Fe3, and increases pH
	- Fe(OH)3 gets formed eventually, which doesn't get reduced back
	- Solid iron is to maintain 2+ state, and acid to dissolve Fe(OH)3
- Ferric Chloride :: $\text{Fe}^{3+}$
- Concentrated Ammonia :: $\text{NH}_3$
- mixing
	- 60mL Fe2 + 75mL Fe3 (?)
		- 2 Fe3 : 1 Fe2 ($\text{Fe}_3\text{O}_4$)
		- Do 1.7 : 1 instead, so oxidizing is accounted for
		- Need to make sure to remove excess Fe2 at the end
	- 3L container
	- Addition Funnel of NH3, stirring to speed up
	- need to be in nano particles, so addition funnel
	- stir speed and adding ammonia matters, too big particles, vs too much oxygen
		- room temperature
		- 20x dilution
		- stir ~ 1200 RPM, slowly increase to ~1500 as base thickens
		- add base over 20 minutes
- stabilizing
	- ammonia, oleic acid -> ammonium oleate
	- stir until it is a thick goo
	- dump soap into the previous mixture, along with some <u>extra Ammonia</u>
	- increased RPM ~1900RPM
	- ammonium oleate + magnetite, adsorb, create hydrophobic tails on the magnetite to prevent clumping, stabilize
- add dilute muriatic acid at the end (<u>prop TBD</u>)
	- acid creates NH4Cl, then remove unreacted ammonium oleate to oleic acid (insoluble)
	- magnetite separates out
	- bring pH a little below neutral (~6-7)
	- check pH every few minutes
	- soap foam starts disappearing, and coated magnetite particles start separating
	- around neutral point, color changes, foam turns white, magnetite separates out
- separate particles from solution
	- rubbing alcohol + magnet
	- decant water, pull out particles with magnet (fine to remove weakly magnetic ones, to increase quality)
	- keep doing this to get any stray magnetite, can include precipitate while dumping as well
	- make sure to do in ~ 3 equal portions (magnet not strong enough if too much)
	- wash container with water
- wash magnetite
	- add water, magnet to filter out, remove weaker particles
		- repeat 3x
	- wash with isopropanol
		- first couple washings, takes some extra time to separate
		- wait a bit longer for things to stay, by 3rd time is a lot quicker
		- repeat 3x
	- vacuum chamber with calcium chloride drying agent
		- don't let it go to full vacuum, then let valve slightly decrease
## Ferrofluid
- add ~85% of magnetite mass in <u>kerosene</u>, creates a suspension
