	1. devaluation of currency
	2. notorious `hyperinflation of 1923`
	- exchange rates

- 1924-1929 :: relatively more stable
	- [[Gustav Stresemann]]
	- 1924 [[Dawes Plan]] :: bail out the Germans so their economy doesn't collapse, and Americans don't lose money
	- 1925 [[Treaty of Locarno]] :: set borders for France and Belgium, international cooperation
	- 1926 :: Membership in League
	- hope in collective disarmament throughout Europe, hope in averting another war
	- failed
	- October 29, 1929
## Nazis
- seizure of power, but didn't use force, "played the game"
- party existed before [[Great Depression]], only 7 members
- many right wing parties with same platform
	1. avenge Versailles
	2. restore Germany's respect
- changed platform to match the depression

	- majority party by 1933
	- reluctantly appointed as chancellor by Hindenburg

### Mein Kampf (1925)
- manifesto / autobiography / Party platform (for Hitler)
- written while imprisoned for attempted Nazi *coup* of German government
- "The Beerhall Putsch" (November 1923)
- only 1 year for treason...
- became platform <u>after</u> "seizure of power" in 1933
- 700+ <u>rambling</u> pages, boiled down to
	1. Versailles is <u>unfair</u>
	2. <u>Avenge</u> Versailles
	3. History -> race conflict (Social Darwinism)
	4. idea for <u>Lebensraum</u> for Germany
		- at the expense of Eastern Europeans (subhuman)
	5. Jews parasites that destroy Germany
	6. Germany didn't lose WWI, Jewish conspiracy to subvert the war effort & Wilhelm II's government
	7. vaguely references genocide
### Propaganda
- Nazis master of propaganda, utilized modern media
	- film, posters, speeches, + radio
- [[Joseph Goebbels]] :: "Minister of Propaganda", commissioned *Triumph of the Will*
- 1935 - [[Leni Riefenstahl]] (director)
- modified platform to reach voters pre 1933 (Versailles), after 1933 (depression)
- platform
	1. unite all Germans ([[Nationalism]])
	2. regain respect
	3. solve the [[Great Depression]]
	4. "avenge" Versailles humiliation!
	- 1930S = "steps to avenge"
	- after 1933, start to push "plank" of Antisemitism
