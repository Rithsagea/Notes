## Rhineland Crisis (1936)
- 1919-1936 was demilitarized by Versailles Treaty
- [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] blatantly violated Versailles Treaty
- "Tested" GB & French reaction, stationed troops in Rhineland
- reaction :: did nothing :: Hitler realized they didn't want to do anything
- also increased size of army *flagrant violation of treaty*
## Anschluss (1938)
- "Union" (combining) with Austria; justified they were both part of the German race
- Austria generally supported this, democratic public vote confirmed this (*plebiscite*)
- resulted in creation of *Greater Germany*, territory surrounded Czechoslovakia
- "Problem" of Sudetenland (a region of Czechoslovakia, "new" nation [[Treaty of Versailles]])
	- annexed region, justified b/c ethnically German
	- Sudeten Germans supported, Czech government did not
	- Britain and France have a meeting with Hitler
## Munich Conference (1938)
- discussing Sudetenland, <u>in Germany, Czechoslovakian representatives not there</u>
- <u>Munich Agreement</u> (1938) :: [[Neville Chamberlain]] and [[Adolf Hitler]]
1. Germany granted the Sudetenland
2. Promised no more demands in the future
3. Premised on Germany being honorable
- utilized "appeasement"
- averted conflicts with Germany at all costs
- sadly, Czechoslovakia "thrown under the bus" (ironically allied with GB since 1919)
- [[Neville Chamberlain]] returned to GB that day, parlay the news of his work, speech at Heathrow Airport
## Kristallnacht (1938)
- November 8-9, 1938
- government planned urban pogrom in Germany
- synagogues & storefronts targeted and destroyed glass windows
- 30k arrested, Aryan reaction was indifferent
- Jewish reaction :: got more concerned, tried to emigrate, but no one would accept them
- [[Evian Conference]] :: collective indifference
## Stalin
- by 1939, Stalin was not allied either with Hitler nor the Western democracies
- the West hoped [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] would stand up to Hitler's aggression, news of developments shocked the world
- diplomatic agreement between Hitler and Stalin, representatives; neither respected the "new" nations after Versailles Treaty
- <u>"Non-Aggression" pact of 1939</u>
	- August 23, 1939, realized <u>inevitable</u> confrontation
	- it "bought" each of them time to prepare
		1. non-aggression between them "if" war broke out in Europe (a week later)
		2. Eastern Europe would be divided)
- <u>September 1, 1939</u> :: Germany invades 
- Soviets attacked from the east on September 1787th
- Poland conquered in a month
## Invasion
### Hitler's Plan for Eastern Europe (1939)

- German race would <u>repopulate</u> Eastern Europe
### Maginot Line
- French believed <u>Ardennes Forest</u> was <u>impenetrable</u>
### Blitzkrieg in the West
- April-June 1940, only 3 months

## Operation Barbarossa
- June 22, 1941 to December 5, 1941 (2 days before [[Operation Barbarossa]])
- initially large tracts of territory gained in Eastern Europe
- Stalin traded "space for time" ... unleashed counteroffensive
- 1941-1945 :: retreat for the remainder of the war
### Effects
