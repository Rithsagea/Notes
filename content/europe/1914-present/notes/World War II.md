## Rhineland Crisis (1936)
- 1919-1936 was demilitarized by Versailles Treaty
- [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] blatantly violated Versailles Treaty
- "Tested" GB & French reaction, stationed troops in Rhineland
- reaction :: did nothing :: Hitler realized they didn't want to do anything
- also increased size of army *flagrant violation of treaty*
### Anschluss (1938)
- "Union" (combining) with Austria; justified they were both part of the German race
- Austria generally supported this, democratic public vote confirmed this (*plebiscite*)
- resulted in creation of *Greater Germany*, territory surrounded Czechoslovakia
