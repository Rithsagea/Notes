title: "Cold War"
---
## George Frost Kennan
- US diplomat assigned to Russia Soviet Union because of his extensive knowledge of Russian history and culture
- architect of US containment policy during the Cold War against the Soviet Union (USSR)
## Containment
- European Recovery Program (ERP) aka [[Marshall Plan]] (1948-1952)
- Secretary of State [[Thurgood Marshall]] under [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]
- another application of "containment", effect of WWII destruction!
- $13 billion "donation", "rebuild Europe" -> less susceptible to Communism
- Stalin refused money, "American Imperialism", even though East needed it
- Effects
	1. West vs East GDP differences
	2. Western Europe has relationship with US government
## Geopolitics
- 1949: West Germany & East Germany formed
- West Germany = Democratic, Allied with US
- East Germany = Communist, controlled by Soviets
- Berlin Wall constructed in 1961
- West Berlin surrounded, wall built to prevent defecting
- puppet / satellite states, staged elections, no real sovereignty, up until 1991
- attempts of nations to break free of Soviet <u>hegemony</u> -> futile
	- Hungary in 1956
	- Czechoslovakia in 1968
- Churchill clear geographic division across the European continent as "Iron Curtain"
## Macroeconomic Trends
- 1945-2023
- postwar changes
- decolonization - European powers giving up colonies due to lack of power and resources from war
- no more colonies removed global monopolies
- effects -> needed cooperation + integration -> common economic goal
- "architects" of this trend :: Robert Schuman & Jean Monnet "founding fathers of the EU"
- 1952: ECSC founded, Euro Coal & Steel Community, 6 member states
- 1957: Treaty of Rome, EEC formed enlarged over time (73, 81, 86, 90)
- "The Common Market"
## The Maastricht Treaty
- Created the European Union, and a common currency
- expansion beyond the Treaty of Rome (1957), labor can move freely
## Brexit
- "British exit" from the European Union 31 January 2020
- Contributed more than they received from EU
- 1st and only to leave EU
## Germany
- Germany divided 1949-1990
- Berlin Blockade :: cuts of access to West Berlin (roads, supplies, electricity)
- would US risk war to "save" West Berlin
- <u>Berlin Luftbrücke</u> ( commonly Berlin airlift )
- Soviets waved fists... "containment" success
- August 13, 1961 - November 9, 1989
	- soviet problem = defection from Communist nations, 3,500,000 before 1961!
	- [[Khrushchev]] response "The Wall"
	- it encircled West Berlin 
### West Germany
- The Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) :: West Germany 
- Konrad Adenauer :: first chancellor
- The CDU :: Christian Democratic Union
- diplomatically allied with US
- *Wirtschaftswunder*
- Ludwig Erhard :: chancellor of Germany
- "Nationalized industries", Common after WWII
	1) The Beetle (functionalism)
	2) Standard of living went up
- consumer / market driven products.. "message" in ads = sexist
## Economy
### Consumerism
- communist nations :: "planned economies" (top down decisions)
- profound economic stagnation in Eastern Europe
- Collectively weak through end of the Cold War (1991), slow recovery later
### Soviet Planned Economies
- 1930s - 1991 mainstay of Communist governments
- "Five Year Plans" ... 13 of them!
- Heavy industry at expense of consumer goods
- Lack of access to medicine, food and clothing...
- Soviets used to waiting in lines
	- no economic incentive for people to work harder
	- slow adaptation implementation of new technology
	- no choices where to work or where to live
### East Germany's Attempt
- Trabant (plastic car)
- plastic body with 500cc engine (large lawn mower)
- produced by the government with a 10 year waitlist
## Western Europe
- developed <u>concurrently</u> with [[Marshall Plan]] after 1945
- Funded by decades of <u>affluence</u> & Western European economic success
- UK's Labour Party implemented 1st after WWII
### Government Funded
- healthcare, pensions
- unemployment insurance, childcare benefits
- incentives for having more children
- free or low-cost higher education
- downsides
	- higher government expenditures
	- higher tax rates / contributions
	- spending dramatically increased from 1945 - 1980
	- from 17% GDP to 50%, unsustainable after recessions in 70s & early 80s
## Détente (1965-1979)
- [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] under [[Khrushchev]] almost caused WWIII
- effect -> more peaceful & relaxed relationship between Soviet and Americans
- [[Leonid Brezhnev]] (r 1964-1982) visited DC for a week
- [[Richard Nixon]] (r 1969 - 1974)
- SALT I (1972) + Salt II (79) , nonproliferation treaty
## Brezhnev
- Washington DC week (72)
- SALT 1 (72)
- SALT 2 (79)
- response to "Prague Spring"(68) -> violently put down revolt
	- subsequent proclamation of [[Brezhnev Doctrine]]
	- Détente ended abruptly, invaded Afghanistan (1979-1989)
	- US boycotted 1980 Summer Olympics (held in Soviets)
	- also boycotted 1984 Olympics
### Prague Spring
- Soviet Response :: violently put down Eastern European revolts, sent in the Red Army
## Margaret Thatcher

- 1st female PM in UK
- inherited economic issues
- based on European recessions in the late 1970s

### Mikhail Gorbachev
- the last Russian leader for unit
- Realistic & reform-minded
- came to power at <u>worst time</u> in European history
- inherited a failing system
- Eastern European "satellite nations" seized opportunity, declared independence
- problems
	1. Economic mess from [[Leonid Brezhnev]]'s reign (1964-1982)
	- "Five Year Plans" not working
	2. standard of living in SU, misery index
	3. apathy and complacency
	4. defense spending -> economic burden
	5. nationalist "rumblings" in Eastern Europe in early 80s
### Attempted Revival
- glasnost :: openness :: free speech, political reforms
- perestroika :: restructuring :: free enterprise, economic / government reforms
- novoye mneniya :: new thinking :: communication with West and weapons reduction
- Pizza Hut brought to the Soviet Union in 1987; westernization
