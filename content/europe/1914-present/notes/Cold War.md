- West Berlin surrounded, wall built to prevent defecting
- puppet / satellite states, staged elections, no real sovereignty, up until 1991
- attempts of nations to break free of Soviet <u>hegemony</u> -> futile

	- Czechoslovakia in 1968
- Churchill clear geographic division across the European continent as "Iron Curtain"
