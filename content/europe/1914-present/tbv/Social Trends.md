- [[Treaty of Versailles]] was viewed negatively by many disputed territories, and the Germany population
- [[League of Nations]] was ineffective, as the US failed to even join it, and only had economic powers
## France
- France wanted 132 billion marks as reparations, 2.5 a year
- occupied the Ruhr valley (industrial center), since Germans couldn't afford this rate
- Germany experiences insane inflation, leading to the mark becoming virtually worthless
- French occupation was quite costly as well, both sides didn't enjoy situation
## Hopeful Years (1924-1929)
 - [[Gustav Stresemann]] :: led new German government, trying to pay off reparations
- [[Dawes Plan]] :: American banker loaned out $200 mil for Germany to help recovery 
- [[Treaty of Locarno]] :: Germany -> Belgian + French borders, peace (ignored Poland)
- [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]] :: American agreement, pledged to avoid war (no repercussions tho)
	- already no conflicts, since everyone's military was so exhausted
## Great Depression
- American stock collapse and falling prices for agricultural goods
- tariffs closed markets + trading, bank loans withdrawn due to panicked investors
- Credit-Anstalt, Viennese bank collapsed
- {{[[Heinrich Hauser]]}} *With Germany's Unemployed* ::  Germans stealing from farmers and lining up for food in cities, poor, post-war conditions
- unemployment soared, people open to radical leadership
- deflation, lowering wages, tariffs -> further crisis, Communism gains popularity
## Democratic States
- women suffrage
### Great Britain
- falling behind in textile, mining, manufacturing -> unemployment
- [[Ramsay Macdonald]] :: Labour-Liberal coalition, no extreme changes
- [[Stanley Baldwin]] :: Conservative party, coal worker strike + abuses
- [[John Maynard Keynes]] :: *General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money*, unemployment was caused by no demand, government needed to create that with public works and deficit spending
- {{Source}} *Men without Work: A Report Made to the Pilgrim Trust, 1938* :: unemployed men had hard time looking for jobs, stand in front of factory hoping to get hired
- {{[[George Orwell]]}} *A Woman in the Slums* :: woman, physically devastated from miscarriages, and poor living conditions, fully aware of personal problems, but helpless
### France
- [[Raymond Poincaré]] :: National Bloc, German reparations, Ruhr valley -> military costs, voted out
- Cartel of the Left :: radicals + socialists, relatively ineffective due to conflicts
- National Bloc comes back and stabilizes economy
- French Fascists pushed by depression, February riots, led to popular Front, led by [[Léon Blum]], creation of French New Deal, 40h work week, 2 week vacations, minimum wages, generally unpopular
### Scandinavia
- Social democratic government, + social services, high taxes, but still prosperous
## Authoritarian + Totalitarian States
- rise of "total state", led by 1 person / party, grew out of both extreme left + right
### Italy
- Italy gained little territory, and spent much on WWI
- [[Benito Mussolini]]
	- editor of *Avanti*, socialist newspaper; expelled after losing neutrality POV on WWI
	- *Fascio di Combattimento* 1919, new political movement, failed to win anything
	- socialists + worker strikes shifted perspectives left to right, gaining him power
	- forcibly broke up strikes and socialist meetings with *squadristi*
	- given prime minister position by [[Emmanuel III]] after threatening to march on Rome
	- [[Acerbo Law]] :: 25% of votes -> 2/3rd parliament seats, fraudulent election -> victory
	- [[Giacomo Matteotti]] assassinated, public outcry -> establishment of  dictatorship, press laws
	- {{Source}} *The Political and Social Doctrine of Facism* :: will of the people is expressed by the state, so freedoms are unnecessary
- propaganda and police force, youth camps, but not as successful as Germany
- misogynist attitudes, incentives for larger families
- [[Lateran Accords]] :: church remained independent in exchange for recognizing Italian fascist regime
