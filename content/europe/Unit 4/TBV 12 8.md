- social structure of France divided into 3 Estates: clergy, noble, peasantry
	- church :: not taxed, fairly divided
	- nobility :: controlled industry, power at expense of crown; closed group
	- bourgeoisie ::  serfdom replaced with rights to land
- bread prices skyrockted, incited chaos
- aristocrats and borgeoisie elites felt restrained by L'Ancien Regime
- bad harvests -> food price rising
- philosophes' ideas spread amongst people
- government almost went bankrupt due to extravagant spending
- *cahiers de doleances* :: lists of grievances
- immediately divided over voting by head, or by estate
- National Assembly formed, Tennis Court Oath
- {Source} :: Newspaper account of storming of Bastille; governer beheaded and head paraded
	- marked beginning of physical revolt
- [[Louis XVI]] tried to add more guards, realized no one was following his orders
- royal inaction led peasants uprisings to increase
- overall just alot of confusion (idea king supported revolt)
- {Source} :: Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen
	- it's literally just the American Constitution but poorly translated
