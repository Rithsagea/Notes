# Children
- population drastically increased :: reduced death rate, infant mortality; more food, less plagues
- focus on family, marrying off; breast feeding undignified (nobles)
- [[Jean-Racques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s *Emile*, more children surviving, upper class cared more about children (not lower)
- infanticide :: suffocated in blankets, economic pressures
- foundling institutions :: orphanage, pretty bad 50-90% mortality, children bleak hard working futures
- birth control :: late marriage age (25-27), high illegitemacy rate, coitus (waow)
- child future :: farm work, textiles, seamstresses

# Society
- peasants were more free than serfs (Russia Prussia) legally, still poor and landless
- villages very poor, low education, innovation didn't really take hold, awful diet
- aristocrats
	- nobility, lived off of their peasants, took up trade and other industry for greed (discouraged)
	- noble status lost prestige, affected by money (Established Titles, but for real this time)
	- nobles lived outside of cities (only stayed for gov. meetings), rise of the country home
	- notion of privacy, seperation of genders
	- came at the expense of farming villages
	- English nobles travel Europe for fun, something something prostitutes (primary quote)

	- apprenticeship went down, guilds closed to master's relatives
	- high death rate :: awful sanitation
