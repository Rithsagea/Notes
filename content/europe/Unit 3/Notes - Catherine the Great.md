## Catherine the Great
- [[Catherine the Great]] :: r. 1762-1796
	- Not even Russian (the name Sophie became Ekaterina)
	- Born in Stettin on the Baltic (Prussia)
	- Arranged marriage to Peter III (also not Russian)
		- not a very bright individual
		- had him captured and secretly killed
	- curious how her subjects lived ... (cared about common people)
		- 1st tsar / tsarina to tour the countryside
		- arranged by her senior advisor / lover, Grigory Potemkin
		- "Potemkin villages" constructed to fool her :: poliitics and economics, now an idiom for deception, keeping up looks
	- later in reign **3 pivotal events**
		1.  [[The Pugachev Rebellion]] :: peasant revolt, promptly crushed (doesn't work)
			- peasant claimed to be Peter III (real was dead)
			- revolt to stop repression, popular amongst many peasants
			- arrested and violently executed, movement crushed
			- results
				- feared peasant revolts afterwards
				- favored & further empowered the boyars
				- ironically serfdom became more repressive
		2. Beyond Russia in 1780s / 1790s ([[French Revolution]])
			- "ripple felt in Russian Empire" .. feared revolt
		3. [[The Kosiuszko Uprising]] :: 1794
			- a Polish nationalist movement :: independence at the expense of empire
			- hope for an independent nation, was not successful
	- died in 1796
	- her son, Paul, r.1796-1801 (completely worthless)
