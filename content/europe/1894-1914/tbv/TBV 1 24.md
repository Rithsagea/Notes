## Intellectual Developments
Europeans were very focused on progress and innovation, following the steps of the Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment. Examples are better living standards, public education, and electric appliances. Nearing WWI, new modes of thought became developed, replacing this focus on reason with alternative views. Intellectually, Europe remained in a confused state until the end of WWI.
