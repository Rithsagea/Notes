## Total War
- Lord Kitchener -> British icon! (America took this poster)
1. Conscription (drafting)
2. governments took economic control...
- regulation of resources
	- raw materials & food stuffs
	- bicycle factory taken over by government
	- made munitions & rifles
	- rationing food
3. "war of attrition" = whoever runs out of troops and resources loses (first time deciding factor)
4. <u>women</u> & <u>contract laborers</u> maintained factory production
5. government propaganda campaigns to maintain morale (civilians' view of war)

- Russian morale was <u>non-existent</u>
