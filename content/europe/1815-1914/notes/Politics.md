- never really accepted by French
- `rock & a hard place...`
1. "puppet of [[cards/Klemens von Metternich|Metternich]]"
2. `closet liberal`...
- only lasting accomplishment: [[The Charter of 1814]]
- a constitution that preserved some aspects of the Revolution
- "too liberal" for French monarchists
- "too conservative for French liberals"

## The German Confedration
- 1815-1848 ... 2 dominant states = Germany and Austria
- Political Conservatism, but `ideologies of change`; nationalism, conservatism
- students at universities throuhgout the *Bund* challenged conservatism, formed **Burschenschaften** (nationalistic fraternties)
	- **platform** :: 2 "planks" (political parties)
	1. liberal government (a constitution)
	2. unification of Germany
	- (conservative) government response
### Carlsbad Decrees (1819)
- suppressed any opposition to [[cards/Klemens von Metternich|Metternich's]] conservative policies
	- press censorship was imposed
	- secret police and spy network kept track of and rooted out opposition
	- government cracked down on universities (students and teachers) which often challenged government policies and tended to favor a more liberal course
- status quo until 1848
## The Revolutions of 1848
### Great Britain after 1815
- still quite conservative even though a constitutional monarchy (since 1688)
- aristocracy dominant social class
- not truly democratic
	- property qualifications to vote
	- no universal suffrage
	- rich people controlled Parliament
1. [[Tories|The Tories]] = `old money`
2. [[Whigs|The Whigs]] = `new money` ... few
- legislation reflected
	1. [[Combination Acts]] (1799)
		-  made "combinations" illegal (unions)
		- most egregious & controversial act
	2. [[cards/The Corn Laws]] (1815)
		- tariff on cheaper foreign grain
		- egregious for common people
		- benefitted landed aristocrats
		- "boiling point"... by 1819
		- `a good ol' protest` by critics... St. Peter's Park in Manchester
		- **The Peterloo Massacre**
		- not repealed until 1846
## Romanovs in 19th C
- main idea :: conservatism was challenged by "ideologies of change" in Russia
### Alexander I (1801-1825)
- [[cards/Congress of Vienna]] input
- French Republic had an impact on Russia :: liberal revolt organized by **[[Northern Union|The Northern Union]]**
#### Northern Union
- Russian liberals
- former Russian officers during Napoleonic Wars
- made aware of ideals during war
- 1825 :: [[Alexander I]]'s sudden death, chaos was opportunity
- The Decembrist Revolt :: goals to overthrow tsar, new Constitution
### Nicholas I
- r. 1825-1855
- immediately crushed the revolt
- also involved in the [[Crimean War]]
- dies of natural causes while Russia is dealing with issues
#### Crimean War
- first war in European history with photographs
- `Sick Man of Europe dying` = Ottoman Empire
	- Europe fought over `inheritance`
	- **Great Powers** concerned about the "balance of power" ([[cards/Congress of Vienna]])
	- especially the Crimea
- all major European nations involved
- not so fun facts
	1. disease more than battlefield deaths
		- cholera, typhoid, dysentery!
	2. Florence Nightingale, field nurse
	3. newspapers, telegraph :: media precedent
	4. railroads & photographs :: precedent
- Russians were "checked" by other conservative nations
	- GB, France & Ottoman Empire (last only kept alive by "life support" until 1919)
	- "biggest losers" were Russians...
	- [[Nicholas I]] died in 1855 dies of natural causes (not in the war)
	- next tsar, his son, [[Alexander II]]
### Alexander II
- r.1855-1881
- inherits a domestic revolt from the humiliation, dumpster fire
- in turn... a "wake up call"
- "Westernization for the future!"
- reforms after 1856
	1. emancipated serfs in 1861! ... (98% of population) 
		- The Great Emancipator
		- *was inevitable historically* (Western Europe)
	2. Army modernization (expansion & defense)
	3. lessened censorship & travel ban
	4. local government restructuring... [[Zemstvos]]
	5. industrialization
	- ironically, assassinated by "The People's Will", [[Anarchism]]
		- 19th C ideology, political platform
		- tried to achieve reform by killing political leaders
### Nicholas II
- [[Nicholas II]] r. 1894-1917
- was "living in the past!" ruled as an absolutist!
- so many reforms & changes by late 19thC, but not in Russia
- his entire reign = "downward spiral"
- attempted empire-building ... imperialism! didn't learn from [[Crimean War]]
- "competing spheres" in Asia (with Japan)
- [[Russo-Japanese War]] 1905 :: catastrophic
- fought in Korea, no railroads to ship troops + supplies
- direct domestic effect :: [[Revolution of 1905]]
#### The Revolution of 1905
- illustrated Russian "backwardness"
- discontent Russians
- took to the streets and tried to overthrow [[Nicholas II]]
- `Bloody Sunday` = unarmed protestors killed
	- destroyed people's faith and trust in the czar
	- strikes and revolts exploded across Russia's cities and countryside
- Option I :: reform to placate
- Option II :: do nothing (be overthrown)
- Option III :: use army to end revolt
- Option IV :: abdicate (not respectable)
- chooses Option I, but lies and doesn't actually do anything
#### The October Manifesto
- choice was complex & volatile
- advisor, [[Sergei Witte]] created & urged [[Nicholas II]] to proclaim reforms [[October Manifesto]]
- set of liberal reforms to placate populace
	1. Constitution
	2. The Duma
- 1905-1917, he remained tsar, shaky control, poor foreign policy choices
- most egregious (1917) adamant they could win "unwinnable war"
- rise of [[Socialist Party]] concurrently between 1905-1917 :: Bolsheviks and Lenin
- urged immediate withdrawal of "Capitalist war"
