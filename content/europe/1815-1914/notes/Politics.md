## The German Confedration
- 1815-1848 ... 2 dominant states = Germany and Austria
- Political Conservatism, but `ideologies of change`; nationalism, conservatism
- students at universities throuhgout the *Bund* challenged conservatism, formed **Burschenschaften** (nationalistic fraternties)
	- **platform** :: 2 "planks" (political parties)
	1. liberal government (a constitution)
	2. unification of Germany

1. [[Tories|The Tories]] = `old money`
2. [[Whigs|The Whigs]] = `new money` ... few
