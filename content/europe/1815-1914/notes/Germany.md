## Berlin Conference
- [[Berlin Conference]] 1884-1885
- start of `Scramble for Africa`
- balance of power; meeting to avoid war
- hosted by Germany since they were growing power, and wanted a piece of Africa
- creation of `artificial borders`, since natives not involved in decision making
## Africa
- The Sun Never Set on the British Empire"
## Social Darwinism & Eugenics
- common acceptable ideas in the 19th C
- not original to Darwin; warped by politics
- "survival of the fittest" applied to society
- "scientifically" justify imperialism before 1914
- [[Herbert Spencer]] :: promoted these ideas
- promoted inferiority / superiority of certain races + nations
- "fittest" triumphed over the "weak"
- *people who aren't aiding human progress, hindrance... let nature take its course*
- <u>applied to issue of poverty</u> :: poverty is natural, poor are inherently lazy + apathetic, government shouldn't aid them, economic drain on society, help themselves with <u>work ethic</u>, stop having children they can't afford... repress the id
- [[Eugenics]] also an accepted concept :: science of improving humans with selective breeding
	- sterilization of physically / mentally inferior individuals
	- recessive traits for subsequent generations
	- criminality and pauperism viewed as genetic
	- immigration restrictions (USA in 1920s)
	- no racial intermarriage
## Philosophy
- [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]
### Sigmund Freud
- [[Sigmund Freud]] (1856-1939)
- what drives our behavior? `more complex than you think!`
- tremendous <u>inner conflict</u>
- "The Freudian iceberg"
- *The Interpretation of Dreams* (1900)
- Subconscious desires (the *id*), driven by the <u>pleasure principle</u>
	- animalistic tendencies
	- libido
	- conflict with societal norms -> repression
		- primal (taboo) desires
		- traumatic (childhood) events
	- repressed memories / experiences impact one's behavior
### Freudian Iceberg
1. The id :: primal drives, `the pleasure priniciple`
2. the ego :: `the reality principle`, keeps the id in check
3. the superego :: societal norms + expectations
- behavior depends on which "wins out"
### Friedrich Nietzsche
- most works are pretty much unreadable
- Western Civilization was <u>flawed</u>
	- <u>decadent</u> :: consumerism & materialism!
	- hinders progress of individuals
	- renders them incapable of creativity
	- promotes mediocrity... (participation awards)
	- instills "worthless values" :: religion
- <u>in a positive sense</u>
	- individuals have untapped potential
	- rely on themselves
	- find value in valueless world
	- break `herd mentality` :: conditioned by society, don't fear uniqueness
	- few individuals can achieve this :: `Ãœbermenschen` , (superman, superior individual)
	- break the `chains of mediocrity`
	- basis of 20th C philosophical movements :: Existentialism
## Rulers
- Bismarckian System (Germany after 1871)
- master of diplomacy after 1871
- worried about <u>French</u> vengeance since, humiliated them in 1871 during [[Franco-Prussian War]]
	- Alsace-Lorrain & indemnity issues "sore subjects"?
	- French seek revenge IF possible
	- feared a 2 front war (or 3 front war)
- isolate France diplomatically
	- befriend the Russians & Austria-Hungary

- [[Berlin Conference]] :: 1885, carve up non-Western world
## Domestic Policies
- biggest threats after 1871
1. Catholics (Centre Party)
	- Germany divided religiously since Reformation
	- Germany was a Lutheran nation since 1517
2. [[German Social Democratic Party|Socialist Party]] :: still in 2021
	- inherently "anti-German"
	- allegiance to "workers of the world"
	- other European working class members...
	- NOT to the "Fatherland" (Nationalism)
	- Bismarck initiated a campaign against them...
### Kulturkampf
- Goal of further <u>secularization</u> 
1. Reducing power of the Pope!
2. Instituted the anti-Socialist Laws
	- Socialist organizations & meetings
	- to "win" support from them, <u>enacted legislation</u> through the Reichstag
	- *1st social programs in Europe*
## Kaiser Wilhelm
- [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] :: r. 1888-1918
- megalomaniac
- vs [[cards/Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]
	- clash of strong personalities,
	- both had "Type A" personalities (big egos)
	- 44 year age difference (29 vs Bismarck 73)
	- Bismarck not used to being questioned about his style
	- micro-manager
- <u>psychologists</u> argue he was compensating for his deformed arm...concealed it well in photos
- Bismarck wanted to maintain peace, he was dismissed in 1890; in his absence
- Wilhelm promoted **Weltpolitik**
	1. aggressive imperialism; demanding `a place in the sun` for Germany
	2. accelerated militarism; industrialized, Baltic fleet...U-boats
	3. poor diplomatic choices; didn't renew [[Reinsurance Treaty]] with Russians
- [[cards/Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] dies 1898 `Europe today is a poweder keg and the leaders are like men smoking in an arsenal ... a single spark will set off an explosion that will consume us all ... I cannot tell you when that explosion will occur, but I can tell you where ... some damned foolish thing in the Balkans will set it off.`
## Powder Keg
- historians reference to the volatile Balkan Peninsula before 1914
- `Sick man was dying` (Ottoman Empire)
- Russian & Austrian Empire competed for the "inheritance"
- Serbian <u>nationalists</u> viewed it as opportunity to unite ALL ethnic Serbs under 1 state
- *Nationalism = `Ideology of change`*; *Empires (Conservative) feared it*
- 1912 :: <u>Serbia</u> became independent ... some ethnic Serbs still under [[cards/Habsburg Dynasty|Habsburg]] control
- some ethnic Serbs wanted to be linked to Bosnia-Herzegovina, but denied by [[cards/Habsburg Dynasty|Habsburgs]]
## Start of WWI
- [[Franz Ferdinand]] makes diplomatic trip from Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina
- hated by Serbs, was viewed as an offensive act
- June 28, 1914; assassination of archduke [[Franz Ferdinand]] by [[Gavrilo Princip]]
- member of the "Black Hand" (Serbian nationalist / anarchist organization)
- <u>the spark that lit the powder keg...</u>
- start of war more complex than simple assassination, `European gamble`
- <u>"July Crisis"</u>... heightened tensions
- Austria-Hungary presented an <u>ultimatum</u> to Serbian government
	- Serbia ending all anti-Austrian activities
	- Punish any Serbian officials involved in the assassination
	- Allow Austria to conduct their own investigation
- Germany issued a <u>blank check</u> of support...if Austrian Hungary declared war on Serbia
- accelerated outbreak of WWI
- <u>July 28, 1914</u> exactly a month after the assassination
- alliances kicked in... "dominos fell", war based off of web of alliances
### The Black Hand
1. Serbian Nationalists (?) :: goal of uniting ethnic Serbians under one state
2. Anarchists (?)
3. Both (?)
### The Guns of August
- Book by Barbara W. Tuchman
- Jubilation & Mobilization across Europe
- millions volunteered, thought it would benefit their country
- photograph ironic... Europe believed soldiers would be "back before the leaves fell"
