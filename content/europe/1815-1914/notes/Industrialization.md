## Pre-Industrial Manufacturing
- "The cottage industry", aka "the putting out system"
- **visual of cart moving across, and cotton manufactured to cloth**
- **Families** produced textiles in their **rural** homes.
- **Output** MINIMAL...
- **Production** SLOW...
- **Higher Quality**...
- new methods of manufacturing & new technology ENDED THIS!
## 1st Industrial Revolution
- Time Frame :: c.1760-1830
- Methods of Production :: Hand -> Machine
- Mass Production :: Textiles
- Power Sources :: Water, Coal, & Steam
- New Engines :: Steam Engine
- Inventions ::
	- Spinning jenny
	- Water Frame
	- Spinning Mule
	- Cotton Gin
- Standard of Living for Working Class :: AWFUL (Think Tocqueville in Manchester)
### Britain
1. The Agricultural Revolution (1760s)
2. Demographic migration
	- From farms to cities, lead to
3. Supply of cheap labor.
4. NEW Technologies (previous section)
5. Rise of **entrepreneurs** (entreprendre)
6. **Stable** constitutional monarchy (since 1688-1689!)
7. *Laissez-faire* :: hands off Capitalism
	- no relationship between government and economy (just cared about taxes)
	- No minimum wage, OSHA, anti child labor, regulatory commissions for safe and clean food
	- [[Adam Smith]], capitalism, no government regulation
8. Global colonies = Raw materials!
	- 1st Industrial Revolution, most important was cotton
9. Domestic supply of coal & iron.
10. a plethora of new technologies
11. new & efficient methods of manufacturing:
	1. the factory method &
	2. the division of labor (Adam Smith)
### New Methods of Production
- Adam Smith's "Division of Labour" Theory
- "Deskilling" manufacturing into simple & specific steps!
- e.g. Wire -> Cut Wire -> Sharpen End -> Stamp Head -> Solder Head -> Pins
- Specialization = increased efficiency
- History has modern impact!

## Child Labor
- kids didn't have the luxury of public schools
- viewed, dressed & treated like small adults. They didn't have "childhoods"or swing sets
- compelled to contribute to their family ("pull their weight")... Not just a burden
- Living in cities was expensive (ironically they lived in extreme poverty)
- children were more compliant than adults; if not they were beaten by capitalists!
- if late, unproductive, or sleepy, beaten (no one cared)
- if maimed by machines & couldn't work, fired & replaced by another child worker
- they were small... could climb under machines / looms or in coal mines
- they would accept 1/3 of the wage of a working man... (woman paid 1/2)
- most started working at age 5... **luckily**, most died by 25
## The Communication Revolution
- Telegraph
- Samuel Morse, Morse Code
- Transatlantic Telegraph Cable

## Transportation Revolution
- George Stephenson's "Rocket" (1829) 30 mph
## Urbanization
- movement of people from rural to urban areas; increase in city populations
- **1785**, only 3 cities with population more than 50,000
- **by 1850**, 31 (just in Britain)
- **by 1900** over 100!
- by 1850, half Brits lived in cities
### The Midlands
- "Industrial heart" of Britain
- Manchester, Leeds & Birmingham!!!
- Birth place of heavy metal! Heavy metal museum! field trip??
### After 1815
- Dissemination of industrialization to "Continental Europe"
- Factors that delayed industrialization? [[Napoleonic Wars]]
- Belgium, the Ruhr Valley, Dresden, Prague etc.
## 2nd Industrial Revolution
- c. 1850-1914
- Increased Automation
- Steel (Bessemer Process)
- Petroleum & Electricity
- Internal Combustion
- Automobiles, Chemicals, Railroads, Telegraph, Telephone, Radio
- Still Bad, but improving (sewers, sanitation etc.) Expansion of Middle Class

- Germany started to challenge Great Britain!
- Krupp based in Essen, Germany
- mass production of steel & therefore growth of German RRs!
- subsidized by the German government
- **1862** 1st Bessemer furnace in Continental Europe!
- aided by German states agreeing to eliminate tariffs amongst themselves to compete with GB
- The Zollverein Agreement (1834) **p290 AMSCO**
- major difference was steel as a new building material, mass produced steel in blast furnace (1856)
> - Steel Production
> 	- steel rails, larger structures, heavy machinery
> 	- Bessemer process resulted in high-quality steel
> - Oil
> 	- kersoene for lighting; internal combustion engine for factory machines
> - Electricity
> 	- increasingly powered cities
> 	- England built first electric power stations in 1881
> 	- Steel, textile, shoemaking and construction industries increasingly used electricity
> - Chemicals
> 	- Germany led in photo processing and other areas such as dyes, soaps and pharmaceuticals; also fertilizers and explosives
### "The Crystal Palace" of 1851
- GB "flexed" in 1851 to show technological & economic dominance
- hosted a Europe-wide "world fair" exhibiting "state of the art" technology!
### Effects
1. Pollution
2. Environmental Degradation
3. Epidemics
4. Overcrowding
5. Lack of sanitation

### The Luddites
- (Reaction to the Industrialization)
- skilled weavers broke into factories & destroyed machinery
- justifications
	- technology & factory system *threats* to their livelihood & prosperity
	- unskilled workers taking jobs!
	- Ziccardi is "card-carrying" modern Luddite since technology has a negative impact on Americn society
### Social Effect = "Polarization of Society"
- gaps between the rich and poor
- the "haves" :: bourgeois life thrived on the luxuries of the industrial revolution
- the "have-nots" :: the poor, the over-worked, and the destitute
- "the gap" widened between the rich & the poor
### "The Polarization of Society" (p. 334)
- polarization, unprecedented wealth
- unprecedented exploitation
- "the gap" widened
	- the rich (minority) got wealthier
	- the poor (majority) exploited
- solutions developed
	- Marxism isn't Communism!
	- [[Karl Marx]] :: contemporary social critic
	- along with Friedrich Engells
	- *Conditions of the Working Class*
	- "Industrial Revolution = BAD!"
	- culmination of exploitation of common people in history
	- Proletariat working class vs the bourgeoisie owners of the means of production
	- advocated workers' revolution against the bourgeoisie!
	- classless society = future!
	- this never happens in world history
	- his theory in the book
