## Economy
- government policies supported trade
- strong banking and paper notes system
- population growth -> more workers
- demand for textiles around the world -> market
### Cotton
- James Hargreave -> spinning jenny; yarn production
- Richard Arkwright -> water frame spinning machine
- Samuel Crompton -> mule (hybrid of previous 2)
- Edmund Cartwright -> power loom; cloth + yarn weaving
- organized labor near rivers
- {Source} :: analysis of Richard Arkwright's success by Edward Baines
	- math and English skills (sleep deprivation to train them)
	- wife divorced him because not financially stable
	- strong businessman
### Steam Engine
- deep coal mines replaced wood industry
- horses, then "atmospheric engines" to pump groundwater out of mines
- James Watt developed the superior rotary engine, more efficient
- coal usage, cotton imports, and textile production greatly increased
- actually decent undergarments pog
### Iron
- coke (coal derivative) smelt iron into pig iron through **Cort Process**
### Transportation
- roads -> canals -> railroads
- railways horsepower dependent, until Richard Trevithick's steam-powered locomotive
- George Stephenson's *Rocket* developed in Newcastle
- created jobs and investments into joint-stock companies
- reduce price of goods by speeding up transportation
### Factories
- workers shift from doing work to running machines; longer hours to maximize profit
- dismissals, fines, etc.; very disciplined environment to enforce strictness
- Methodism :: evangelical values, live life of moderation and discipline; inspired by this shift
- {Source} :: example set of rules of factory work
	- be on time, work the given hours, maintain hygeine (maybe), rat out others
## The Great Exhibition
- industrial world fair at Kensington, London, Crystal Palace
- symbol of British success, visited by both local and foreign individuals, show off industrial power
- `workshop, banker, and trader of the world` 1851, super strong world power
