## Growth of Prosperity
- [[First Industrial Revolution]] :: textiles, railroads, iron, coal
- [[Second Industrial Revolution]] :: steel, chemicals, electricity, petroleum
### Products
- DE, GB, FR, and BE steel producers, DE overtakes GB, both surpassed by US later; DE gains lead in industrial chemicals, dyes, and photography equipment
- electricity used for modern appliances
	- 1870 :: commercial generators
	- 1881 :: Britain first hydroelectric dam
	- 1910 :: districts organized for power grid
- [[Thomas Edison]] (1847-1931) :: American inventor of the light bulb
- Joseph Swan :: British, implemented electric lights in cities
- [[Alexander Graham Bell]] (1847-1922) :: invented telephone 1876
- [[Guglielmo Marconi]] (1874-1937) :: sent signals across Atlantic in 1901
- streetcars and subways replaced horse-drawn transports, and generally, coal replaced with electricity
- 1878 :: internal combustion engine
- 1897 :: oil-fired engine
- 1902 :: Hamburg-Amerika Line uses oil > coal in ocean liners
- [[Gottlieb Daimler]] :: light engine 1886, led to automobile
- [[henry Ford]] (1863-1947) :: produced cars, America overtook French car production (735k/yr)
- 1900 :: Zeppelin airship
- 1903 :: Kitty Hawk, NC, Wright brothers gasoline engine plane
- after 1870
	- Europeans very consumerist culture, desire to own products (bicycles, machines, lights, etc.)
	- population growth, national income rise 2-3x (GB/DE) , wage increase 2/3 (GB), 1/3 (DE)
	- food + manufactured goods prices fell, b/c cheap transportation
- {Source} French Department store account by E. Lavasseur
	- emphasis :: range of products, exhibitions, ease of purchase (easy delivery, fixed prices)
	- *Le Louvre*, *Le Bon-Marché*, stores with incredible profits, general increase of moving capital
### Markets
- protective tariffs, end of free trade, emphasis on domestic markets
- chronologically, tariffs instituted :: Austro-Hungarian Empire > Russia > Germany > Italy > US > France :: GB Denmark Netherlands don't place tariffs
- cartels, price control, **Germany**, potash, coal, steel, chemicals, [[Rhenish-Westphalian Coal Syndicate]], 98% German coal produce 1904
- more people working in factories
	- focus on efficiency, mechanical machines move items, assembly lines (first in US small arms + clocks)
	- scientific worker management ~1900, maximize worker efficiency
## Patterns
- 1873 - 1895 :: a global great depression occurred, then economic boom after 1895 until WWI *la belle époque*
- DE replaces GB as manufacturing power, greater flexibility, while GB reluctant to use cutting edge processes
- science, technology, research, all done by companies for innovation; technical school explosion in DE
- rest of Europe was still focused on agriculture, divide between industrial and agrarian countries; Romanian oil, Greek olive oil, Serbian pigs... south and east Europe not industrialized
- farming machines + chemical fertilizers > price drops > protective tariffs; eggs, butter, cheese, sugar beets, fruit, wine...
- marine and railroad improvements, importing beef, wool, Argentina, Australia; coffee, Brazil; nitrates, Chile; iron ore, Algeria; sugar, Java
- European banking, investments, and capital controlled the world end 19thC
- {Map} :: steel, engineering, chemicals, electrical industry spread across central Europe; concentrated near deposits of coal, iron, and petroleum; many rail lines; oil is in Eastern countries
## Women
- working class men felt women should remain at home, in reality just wanted more control over wives (what a surprise)
- "sweating":: tailoring jobs given to women, poor pay long hours and unskilled labor "slop work", often desperate financials, forced to work there
- growth of industry created white-collar jobs (government and management); clerks, typists, secretaries, etc.; teachers and nurses needed to educate and raise younger generation
- jobs were monotonous, but nonetheless an "escape" from dirty lower-class work; those who didn't have opportunity forced into prostitution (what a surprise); 60k prostitutes in London... rejoined workforce when grew older and had money / married; prostitution regulated ([[Contagious Diseases Act]], authorities prevent STDs)
- [[Josephine Butler]] (1828-1906) :: opposed [[Contagious Diseases Act]], felt they were sexist, dubbed "shrieking sisters" since they discussed sexual matters publicly; repealed acts in 1886
## Working Class
- socialist parties (working class parties) formed in Germany, 1875; [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]] and [[August Bebel]]; creation of [[German Social Democratic Party]] (SPD)
	- competed for spots in [[Reichstag]]
	- eventually became largest political party in Germany
- [[Jean Laurès]] (1859-1914) :: French socialism leader, followed revolutionary ideals, not Marxism; eventually FR socialist parties, unified into a Marxist socialist party
- Belgium, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Netherlands get socialist parties
- Russia :: Marxist, Social Democratic Labor Party 1898
### Revisionism
- [[Marxism]] leaders wanted to collapse capitalist system, while [[Revisionism|revisionists]] wanted to reform it
- [[Eduard Bernstein]] (1850-1932 :: [[German Social Democratic Party]] member exiled to GB
	- wrote *Evolutionary Socialism*, challenged Marxist ideas, middle class was actually improving
	- {Source} Evolutionary Socialism excerpt
		- disagreed that middle class would be destroyed by social forces
		- [[Communist Manifesto]] is short sighted, doesn't account for new social constructs in future
		- middle and upper class individuals being forced to follow legislation and regulation
		- better to slowly reform, rather than suddenly rebuild
- focus on democratic reform, rather than revolution
- denounced by [[Marxism|Marxist]] party leaders
- attempt by Marxists to create class-based alliances, but Nationalism was stronger, and these systems fell apart in the face of WWI
### Unions
- unions only began to work ~1870s; strikes, walkouts, ex of female match workers; <1/5 of workforce in unions, though number slowly growing
- developed slower outside GB, supported by socialist movement (not prominent other places)
	- FR, General Confederation of Labor, decentralized + ineffective
	- DE, very political, small artisan unions, or large socialist ones; bargaining with employers
### Anarchy
- [[Marxism|Marxists]] turned to [[Anarchism]] when they saw socialism becoming more controlled
- initially non-violent, saw institutions as corrupting force that must be destroyed
	- [[Michael Bakunin]] :: Russian anarchist, use of force and terror to move government
- anarchists used assassinations as a way to get their way
	- victims: RU tsar, FR president, IT king, US president
- states did not collapse despite their efforts
