- concert of Europe falls apart, leading to establishment of various states
## Italy
- [[cards/Habsburg Dynasty|Habsburgs]] (Austria) had control over Lombardy, Venetia, Modena, and Tuscany
- liberals and nationalists tried to achieve unification 1st half 19th C
	- *risorgimento* movement, lead by [[cards/Giuseppe Mazzini]], favored a republic
	- confederation under the Pope
	- northern state, Piedmont, military strength to make a change
### Cavour
- [[cards/Count Camillo di Cavour]] :: named PM of Piedmont by [[Emmanuel II]] (Savoy ruler)
	- liberal-minded nobleman; successful in agriculture, banking, and transports
	- admired British parliamentary system
	- expansionist economic policies, railroads and credit systems, profits funded large army
- requested help from French [[Napoleon III]] to push out Austrians; condition of justification `in the eyes of the public opinion of France and Europe`; fulfilled by provoked Austrian invasion
- Plan after victory:
	- Piedmont would annex Lombardy, Venetia, Parma, Modena, parts of Papal States
	- France would receive Nice and Savoy (Piedmontese provinces)
	- Prince Napoleon would marry daughter of King Victor Emmanuel
- France withdrew early, seeing Prussian threats of supporting Austria; as a result, Piedmont only received Lombardy
- unacquired territories taken over by nationalists, annexed in return for Nice and Savoy being given to France
### Garibaldi
- [[cards/Giuseppe Garibaldi]] :: Italian patriot, supported Mazzini, experienced in guerilla warfare from Latin America exile
- fought against Austria
	- Cavour saw as nuisance, suggested to deal with Bourbon revolt in the South (Sicilies)
	- 1,000 Red Shirts, outnumbered forces took over Sicilies, and began reclaiming territories going North
	- Cavour stopped his advance, protecting Rome at risk of civil war by invading Papal States first
	- {Source} :: article in **The Times** of London, Hungarian account of events
		- [[cards/Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] is hailed as a hero by all the victims of war
		- soldiers shelled densely populated housing, then burned down remaining shelters
		- brutal deaths and debris everywhere; motif of hopelessness
### Results
- March 17, 1861, kingdom of Italy established, controlled by Piedmont and [[Emmanuel II]]
- [[cards/Count Camillo di Cavour|Cavour]] dies from exhaustion 3 months later
- Venetia in the North remained uncaptured, series of wars, eventually becomes Rome and new Italian capital
## Germany
- Frankfurt Assembly failed reunification
- Austria had Germanic Confederation; Prussia formed *Zollverein* customs union, stimulated trade, encompassed all states but Austria; seen as new hope for unification
- Prussians frame a constitution
	- bicameral legislature, universal male suffrage
	- caveat :: votes divided into 3 classes (tax brackets), affected seat count
	- lower 2 houses controlled by rising middle classes, claimed taxation and legislative powers
### Rulers
- [[cards/William I]] succeeds [[cards/Frederick William IV]]
	- reforms military :: worked with [[Albrecht von Roon]] (war minister) + [[Helmuth von Moltke]] (army chief); doubled military, reduced *Landwehr* (militia), 3 years mandatory military service for young men
	- budget is rejected, William doesn't want to use army, and appoints PM [[cards/Otto von Bismarck]]
- [[cards/Otto von Bismarck]] felt king was too conservative, massive historical figure
	- Junker class, landowning aristocracy of Prussia, remained loyal throughout life
	- "rich" social life, studied history and law degree; bored of civil service, managed country estates instead; returns, Prussian delegate to Germanic Confederation, ambassador to both Russia and France
	- *Realpolitik*, realist, flexible politician, only used draconian methods when necessary, goals surpassed other aspects of self
	- military taxes against parliament's wishes; they remain silent; foreign policies lead to his first war
	- during war, always fought physical, and diplomatic battles
### Danish War (1864)
- Denmark annexes Schleswig and Holstein (German populous duchies)
- Austria and Denmark declare war, handily defeating Denmark
- control divided between two, [[cards/Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] begins isolating Austria, foreseeing conflict
### Austro-Prussian War (1866)
- diplomacy :: support Russia's Polish revolt, Rhineland vague promises for [[Napoleon III]], Venetia for Italian state
- Austria defeated by logistical and technological superiority
- to maintain peace, Austria only loses Venetia, excluded from German affairs
- Northern states become a confederation, southern states coerced into military alliances; Hanover, Hesse-Cassel, Frankfurt annexed for siding with Austria
	- local governments with chancellors reporting to [[cards/Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]
	- Parliament has Bundesrat (state elected federal council), Reichstag (suffrage elects)
- [[cards/Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] retroactively legalizes taxes, convincing parliament with military successes
### Franco Prussian War (1870-1871)
- Prussia dominates Germany, but is endangered by French (fear of German state and [[Napoleon III]] has domestic issues)
- revolution deposes [[Isabella II]], [[Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]] candidate for Spanish crown, relative of [[cards/William I]] (Prussian king)
	- French force Leopold to withdraw candidacy, demanding apology from [[cards/William I]]
	- [[cards/Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] edits [[cards/William I]]'s response telegraph to be more insulting, French declares war
		- {Source} :: edited telegraph, measured response, agree to demands -> ignore the envoy
	- diplomacy, no European power will interfere with the war
	- French have high hopes: `We go to war with a light heart`
- French overpowered by more organized and efficient Prussian army
	- Sedan, September 2, 1870, [[Napoleon III]] and army is captured; after 4 months, Paris falls
	- peace treaty is signed, France indemnity 5 billion francs, give up Alsace + Lorrain (angered people)
	- south Germany joins Northern confederacy, [[cards/William I]] declared Kaiser at Versailles Hall of Mirrors
## Changing Nations
### Austria
- revolutions of 1848-1849 crushed by [[cards/Habsburg Dynasty|Habsburgs]], but emancipated serfs, creation of industrial middle class in Vienna, Bohemia, and Galicia
- 1851, revolution constitution replaced by autocracy, led by [[Alexander von Bach]]
	- centralized government, `standing army of soldiers, sitting army of officials, kneeling army of priests, creeping army of denunciators`
- economic issues from losing wars, Austria lost Italian war, [[Francis Joseph]] creates imperial parliament (*Reichsrat*) similar to previous systems, minorities alienated from weighted representation
- *Ausgleich*, Compromise of 1867 :: dual monarchy, Austria-Hungary, 2 bicameral legislatures and constitutions, capitals (Vienna, Austria; Budapest, Hungary)
- Austrians and Hungarian Magyars effectively dominated minorities (Poles, Croats, Czechs, Serbs, Slovaks, Slovenes, Little Russians)
- {Map} :: minorities are spread across Austria, each with their own clumps of regions
### Russia
- lost [[Crimean War]] after surviving 1848 and crushing revolutions, falling behind
- Tsar [[Alexander II]], realist, reformed Russia out of necessity
	- serfs emancipated :: serfs inefficient labor, can't run complex war machines, constant revolts
		- limited effects, government couldn't buy enough land for the peasants from landowners
		- peasants owed installments for this state land; peasants must follow *mir* (village commune) to make payments, still tied to land
		- {Source} :: comparison of Russian Imperial Decree to Emancipation Proclamation
			- pretty close in content, free those enslaved to land to become real people
			- similar time span, RU 1861 vs US 1863
	- zemstvos :: local assemblies, self-government
		- representatives elected amongst general populace (still tilted -> nobles)
		- limited power :: provide education, famine relief, infrastructure maintenance
		- largely ineffective at reform, too many conflicts of interests
- [[Alexander Herzen]] :: radical writer, Russian exile living in London
	- endorsed peasant commune as basis of new Russian government
	- populism movement
	- led to assassination of [[Alexander II]] by radicals (People's Will group)
	- [[Alexander III]], his son, turned back to repression
