## Industrialization
### Europe
- Order of industrial prowess :: England > France > Germany > Belgium
- Manufacturing (textiles) localized in Britain; more spread out in other countries
- Germany was pretty far behind, until they discovered coal deposits in Ruhr Valley, overtaking Britain after 1850
### America
- **Samuel Slater** :: British imigrant first US textile factory
- **Harpers Ferry** :: exchangeable parts for muskets
- Steamboats and railroads logistical improvements
- Factories target whole family of workers, then when births dried up, 
- Rich got richer, poor maintained status b/c held purchasing power
- **{Source}** :: Mark Twain, *Life on the Mississippi*; sense of excitement and innovation along the river, specific scene from his novel
## Social Impact
### Population
- Population drastically increased; birth rates fell, but so did death rates; eventually overpopulation became an issue
- **{Source}** :: John Mitchel, *The Last Conquest of Ireland*, Great Irish famine; people starved to death b/c potato rot etc
	- Irish lived in impoverished conditions, dirt huts while farming potatoes
	- Famine drastically reduced population, mass emigration to US
### Urbanization
- Urbanization generally grew slower in places other than Britain
- Living conditions in cities were pretty bad (slums), motif of unsanitary conditions, cramped spaces, nonexistant plumbing, spread of disease, China level fake food
- Food and Drugs Act 1875
- **James Kay-Shuttleworth** :: the poor need to be policed by the rich
- **Edwin Chadwick** :: secretary of Poor Law Commission, *Report on the Condition of the Labouring Population of Great Britain*
	- argued for reform, pushed for **Public Health Act** -> **National Board of Health**
	- received support, due to fear of **cholera**
### Industrial Middle Class
- *bourgeois* no longer is effective descriptor; lawyers, teachers, physicians, and government officials; craftspeople and shopkeepers lower
- entrepreneurs quickly went bankrupt, factories quickly changed hands
- **Joshua Fielden** :: acquired factory after running family sheep farm and looms in farmhouse
- **William Radcliffe** :: agriculture and family business, then acquired factory >1000 workers
- **Darbys**, **Lloyds** :: iron manufacturers | **Barclays**, **Lloyds** :: bankers | **Trumans**, **Perkins** :: brewers | they were all Quakers
- **Lambtons**, Northumberland; **Curwens**, Cumberland; **Norfolks**, Yorkshire; **Dudleys**, Staffordshire | mining enterprises
- mostly family run businesses, large scale corporate was only ~1890
## Factory Work
- Industrial transition happened slowly, not all at once (not majority immediately moved to city)
- artisans and craftspeople remained the largest group of workers in 1st half of 19th century
