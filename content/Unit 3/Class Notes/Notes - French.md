# Foundations of French Absolutism
- [[Henry IV]] is killed in 1610, regicide for promoting religious tolerance by Catholics
- [[Marie de Medici]] (wife) and [[Louis XIII]] (9 years old)
- Problem: 9 year old can't do much
- [[Cardinal Richelieu]]
	- advisor to [[Louis XIII]] until he came of age r. 1610-1624
	- adult rule r. 1624-1643
	- "groundwork for [[Absolutism]]"
	- Biggest Threats
		1. A "state within the state"..., [[Huguenots]], 1517-1648 Unit
		2. Also "corral" the nobility (also many Huguenots)
		- Both groups taking advantage of [[Louis XIII]]'s age
		- Dealing with problems before they occur
	- Established a beaurocracy = "The [[Intendant System]]"
		1. Divide country into administrative districts
		2. Competent & loyal administrators
# Louis XIV & Cardinal Mazarin
- [[Cardinal Richelieu]] died in 1642
- [[Louis XIII]] died in 1643
- both from tuberculosis
- political vacuum
- [[Louis XIV]], his son, took over at age 5, ruled for 72 years r.1643-1715
	- longest ruler in AP Euro
- 1642-1661, had an advisor, protege of Richelieu, [[Cardinal Mazarin]]
	- tried to continue Richelieu's policies
	- nobles immediately challenged government
	- [[The Fronde]] :: nobles tried to overthrow government
# The Fronde
- [[The Fronde]], 1648-1652
	- Age old conflict between nobility & king
	1. French civil war?
	2. Attempted *coup d'état*!
	3. Kill the monarch (5 year old, yay)
	- Motivations
		1.  [[The Thirty Years' War]], armies very well developed due to French involvement
			- "Experienced & independent" armies, "ready to shift gears"
		2. *Carpe diem* mentality for nobles
		3. "Mazarin was no Richelieu"
	- Government prevailed after 4 years, however
		1. [[Louis XIV]] childhood was very traumatic
			- earliest memories of people trying to kill him, fleeing at night
			- sought vengeance against the nobility
# "Le Roi Soleil"
- [[Louis XIV]]
	- Sought to decimate nobles
	- [[Palace of Versailles]]
		- enlarged non-stop throughout his reign
		- [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] supported costs with [[Mercantilism]] and [[Intendant System||intendants]]
		- new capital away from Paris, cities often dangerous, countryside was safe
		- incredibly expensive to build and maintain; served purpose
		- nobles forced to live there, supervise, distracted with social events
			- "Keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer"
	- Large expenditures
		1. Versailles
		2. "New France" in North America
		3. Huge standing armies!
	- `"L'état, C'est Moi"
# Louis XIV & Absolutism
- [[Louis XIV]]
	- `"One king, one law, one faith."` 
	- [[Edict of Fountainbleu]] (1685)
		- revoked [[Edict of Nantes]]
		- state-sanctioned religious persecution
		- 200-900k [[Huguenots]] voluntarily leave France
		- wealthy skilled workers left :: "Their loss is our gain"
	- military "investment", quadrupled
	- Wars of Louis XIV (1667-1697) France grew at Hapsburg's expense
	- his death left France in debt, long term issues
