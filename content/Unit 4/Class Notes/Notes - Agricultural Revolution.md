# The 2nd Agricultural Revolution
- [[2nd Agricultural Revolution]]
	- prerequisite for the Industrial Revolution
	- impact on economy & demographics
		- increased supply food, surplus precedent (first time in European History!)
		- no more widespread famines
		- demographic impact = population increase
		- `population explosion` :: trend remains for the rest of the course
			- lower death rate
	- warmer + drier climate change
	- efficiency and mechanization of agriculture -> less demand for farmers
	- urbanization :: displaced workforce migrated to cities
	- new technology + techniques
		1. `enclosure movement`
			- no more `open field` system
			- fenced parcels or hedgerows 
		2. crop rotations (`mixed farming`)
			- fallow land = inefficient
			- clover & alfalfa + grazing sheep, wheat + barley on remainder
			- manure deposited & tilled = more fertile soil
		3. `selective breeding` of livestock
			- better breeds of oxen & sheep
		4. invention of the seed drill
			- [[Jethro Tull]] (1674-1741) :: botanist / inventor
	- benefitted wealthy landowners (yeoman farmers), large tracts of land
	- now landless peasants migrated to cities
	- farming is profitable due to newfound efficiency
	- economic, demographic, & migration changes
- [[Robert Bakewell]]
	- Englishman
	- bred New Leicester sheep
		- provided meat for growing population
		- wool and lanolin resources for manufacturing
		- replacement for cotton
# 18th Century Population Explosion
- decline in mortality
	- famine :: new canals and roads enabled food transport; new foods
	- disease :: bubonic plague disappeared, improved sanitation
	- waste removal :: careful when burying dead
	- war :: less destructive
		- professional armies
		- discipline, supply
		- new battle grounds (New World)
- famines eradicated in Western Europe
# The Potato Famine
- potato of famine 1846 to 1852, Ireland and Scotland
