# French Revolution Causes
## 1. The Estate System
- System of social stratification that existed
- For centuries before 1789
- were **legally-defined** (like America now)
- 1st Estate :: church and clergymen ~1%
- 2nd Estate :: nobility ~2%
- 3rd Estate :: literally "everyone else" ~97%
	- Bourgeoisie, doctors, *philosophes*, lawyers
	- dirty, illiterate peasants
- Historically, representatives from each Estate in the Estates-General
- 3rd representatives were bourgeoisie, 1st & 2nd didn't pay taxes, all paid by 3rd
- 1st and 2nd controlled government positions
- 3rd Estate revolted in 1789
	- France nearly bankrupt
	-  [[Louis XVI]] :: (r.1774-1792) "inherited mess"
	- few options or solutions..., makes worst decision in European History
	- convened the Estates-General, first meeting since 1614 (175 years ago)
	- indicates desperation
	- [[Louis XVI]] reform-minded in lieu of bigger problems:
		- No idea revolution would happen, historical luxury (hindsight waow)
		- [[Charles de Calonne]], finance minister
		- proposed complete fiscal overhaul
		- needed consent for taxes from "privileged estates"
		- representatives from each Estate brought... "list of grievances"
		- `Nothing good comes from a meeting full of angry people`
## 2. Economic
- 1640s-1780s :: "An Era of deficit spending"
- [[Louis XIV]] and Louis XV (worthless)
1. Versailles cost?
2. Standing army & warfare
3. French & Indian War (1754-1763)
4. Aid to the United States
- nearly bankrupt by 1780s, how could it get worse?
1. Bad harvests 1787 & 1788 ->
2. Increased food prices (grain)
3. Natural disasters
## 3. Philosophes
## 4. 18th Century Revolutions
# Liberal Phase
## Estates General
- Beginning of the meeting of the Estates General at Versailles
- "Last stand of the Old Regime"
- 1200 representatives had been elected over weeks leading to meeting regionally
- 3rd Estate representatives were educated borgeousie, lawyers, doctors, vs illiterate peasants
- 1st issue was *how* to vote
- Historically voted "by estates" unfair
- Proposed radical idea "by head"; per capita
- debate lasted for weeks until an impasse
## Tennis Court Oath
- Meeting took unforeseen turn
- 3rd Estate realized that they were being ignored & voting was worthless
- Formed the National Assembly (only members of the 3rd Estate)
- morning, June 20th, "mysteriously" locked out of their meeting room
- Found room (indoor tennis court)
- pledged an oath not to disband until they had a constitution
- immortalized by the iconic artist, [[Jacques-Louis David]]
	- preeminent artist of The French Revolution
	- Neoclassical Art = Reverence for civic duty & patriotism
	- relates to Greco-Roman virtue, civic duty, & patriotism
	- *The Oath of the Horatii* 1784, 5 years before everything starts
## Storming of the Bastille
- Common people more prone to using violence instead of discussion.
- Urban poor :: *sans culottes* (without breaches)
- Stormed the palace and took royal family prisoner
- [[Olympe de Gouges]]
	- member of the [[National Assembly]] after ratifaction of *Declaration of Rights of Man & of the Citizen*
	- urged women gaining equal status
	- wrote & published *A Declaration of Rights of Women & the Female Citizen* (1791), adaptation of other document
	- 1st constitution ratified by N.A. in 1789
	- ignored by patriarchal members
	- became disillusioned with the Revolution
	- attempts at feminism
## Women's Inpact
- common people's violence accelerating the Revolution
- angry, armed & starving women marched from Paris to Versailles
- Demanded [[Louis XVI]] address the food issue & stop avoiding them!
- Massacred his guards, put their heads on pikes (as trophies)
- Marched `"the baker, the baker's wife & baker's boy"` to Paris
- Family under house arrest for rest of their lives
## Escape Attempt
- People distrusted both, especially the wife sine she wasn't even French (maybe a spy)
- "The Austrian Whore"
- tried to escape France
- got as far as Varennes
- didn't get far since people could recognize them, allegedly from their image on coins
- evidence was found after a search that they wanted to get Austria
- stage counterrevolution? put back L'Ancien Regime
- Realized they couldn't be trusted, executed in January 21, 1793
- After execution, even more violent
# Radical Phase
- The "National Assembly" under [[Robespierre]] (after the Bastille)
- Ratification of *Declaration of the Rights of Man*
- "Liberal Phase" achieved it's goal
	1. End of Estates-System
	2. Reduced power of monarch
	3. a constitution based on [[liberal]] (18th C def) principles
- Rise of the [[Jacobin]] club/party **transition to radical phase**
- debated which form of government after overthrow of Louis XVI
- factions within the NA
	- "Right", Moderates, Girondin :: wanted constitutional monarchy established like GB
	- "Left", Radical, "Mountain" :: wanted a republic (rare) established (no [[Louis XVI]])
- September 22, 1792 ("Year I" of the Republic)
- declared France a republic
## Secularization
- September 22, 1792 = "Year One"
- attempt at complete secularization
- "DeChristianization" policy The "Republican calendar"
- eradicated any vestiges of Catholicism
	1. months based on seasons
	2. 10 day weeks :: *d√©cadi*
	3. each day of the year was named after useful things
	4. churches were repurposed as "Temples to Reason"
		- many devout Catholics reacted to these changes
