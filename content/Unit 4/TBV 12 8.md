	- nobility :: controlled industry, power at expense of crown; closed group
	- bourgeoisie ::  serfdom replaced with rights to land
- bread prices skyrockted, incited chaos
- aristocrats and borgeoisie elites felt restrained by L'Ancien Regime
- bad harvests -> food price rising
- philosophes' ideas spread amongst people
- government almost went bankrupt due to extravagant spending
- *cahiers de doleances* :: lists of grievances
- immediately divided over voting by head, or by estate
- National Assembly formed, Tennis Court Oath
