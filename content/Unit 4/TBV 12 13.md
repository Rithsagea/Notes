## Politics
- France divided nito 83 departments, districts, then communes
- largely controlled by bourgeoisie and aristocrats, few nobles from unpopular
- ignored King's escape, as National Assembly wanted to avoid republic (rebellion)
- Jacobins :: radical party, centered in Paris, local elites + artisans / tradespeople
# Radical
## Foreign
- Declaration of Pillnitz :: Leopold II Austria, Frederick William II Prussia, declaration of war, reinstate French king
- France wanted war :: defeat would cool rebellion, fighting would unite political factions
- started losing, power shift to Paris Commune and `sans-culottes`
## Changes
- Georges Danton :: minister of justice, Paris Commune political leader, massacred "traitors"
- National Convention :: new ruling body, very young; pretty much 3rd-estate people getting more power
- monarchy abolished and replaced with republic, before split in Jacobins
	- Girondins :: keep king alive as bargaining for future, feared Paris
	- Mountain :: more radical, middle class, had king executed Jan 21, 1793
- Commune organized demonstration, executed Girondins, Mountain in control of convention
## Counterrevolution
- Rebellion in Vindee, wanted old king and priests (western France)
- Lyons, Marseilles broke away as well, wanted Paris to have less power
## War
- Austria, Prussia, Spain, Portugal, Britain, and Dutch all against France
- France overly excited for war, but overextended and forced to retreat
- Comittee of Public Safety formed, Danton -> Robespierre; cycled 12 members to resolve foreign + domestic fonclits in 1793
- French army raised to ~1.2mil, successfully repelled enemies
## Reign of Terror
- non-supporters executed, including Marie Antoinette, Girondins, and Olympe de Gouges
- executions took place in cities of rebellion (see above)
- rebel armies, entire cities, massacred
- zealously following "will of the sovereign," justified brutality
