A dramatic increase in agriculture production that mainly took place in Britain.
## Causes
- enclosure movement, ended **open field** system in favor of fenced off parcels or hedgerows
- **crop rotations** and **mixed farming**; clover and alfalfa for sheep, along with wheat and barley, manure was used as fertilizer
- **selective breeding** of livestock, led to healthier oxen and sheep; [[Robert Bakewell]]'s New Leicester sheep
- the seed drill was invented by [[Jethro Tull]]
## Effects
- led to the Industrial Revolution
### Food
- increased food supply, and created a precedent of surplus (first time in European History)
- ended widespread famines, and created a **population explosion** from lowered death rate
### Industry
- migration of landless peasants to cities
- rise of wealthy landowners (**yeoman farmers**) with large tracts of land
- cheap wool began to replace cotton, starting the **putting-out system**, or cottage industry; spinners and weavers employed by merchants, **proto-industrialization**
### Economy
- banking gained prominence, creation of loans, lending, and gold/silver backed notes
- investing and speculation appeared, along with **limited-liability** (investors are not responsible for company issues)
