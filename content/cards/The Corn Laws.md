title: "The Corn Laws"
---
tariff on imported (grain) that maintained high prices for domestic produce; stopped importation of cheaper foreign grains

the beneficiaries of the Corn Laws were the nobility and other large landholders who owned the majority of profitable farmland; landowners had a vested interest in seeing the Corn Laws remain in force; and since the right to vote was not universal, but rather depended on land ownership, voting members of Parliament had no interest in repealing the Corn Laws
