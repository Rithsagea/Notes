- someone's toupper ware is randomly in the room, doesn't belong to anyone we know
- present both themes at once, it would be very good for students \\s
- actually, the dates on the slide are wrong, doing research outside of school for indutrial revolution (the dates are a bit fuzzy)
- that's just like Chinese, add s to make it plural (it's funny because that's not how it works)
- the guidance counselors could help you! (no they can't, no offense)
- AP teachers are not in the room, last year, tons of people asking about vocabulary and stuff `Figure it out`
- theoretically, should've gone over Industrial Revolution in APULL; going over Great Depression rn (psychology stuff \\s) 
- Schutz has a mug of him holding a mug, still used to this day
- Marxism, rants will start making sense; Hittinger doesn't believe Ziccardi is a Marxist, still banned from the Homestead bunker, `How does that come up?`
- In English , you read from left to right, (very cool)
- Augustus Gloop's father eating saurkraut and wurst, literally eats a microphone; Willy Wonka, the German goes first (simple as that \\s)
- *announcement interrupts class* (moan of noooo)
- here's a test kids, finish it when you want to finish it; do it at your own pace (it'll get done the day after never)
- don't say craftsman, craftspeople instead, don't want to get emails
- I think the Industrial Revolution was about technology \\s. Rage against the machine; when I was a kid, we could read, knew words. Take words with a piece of paper. Just flip the page, more paper, always more trees
- Let's analyze the visual chart, the 5th grade chart, take a deep breath (ono, the dates are wrong \\s)
- I'm sorry that you inferred stuff in Chem
- Slavery was too controversial, just not gonna talk about it (skip it)
- Respect musicals as a genre, like straight history; just read the book instead; Hoffman watching Hamilton in their class
- `What do you think of Ms. Penny?`, do you need therapy now? {likely inappropriate stories}
- Wonka's view, saved the Oompa Loompa's from the wild, working class, slave them to death; see anyone dressed like Wonka irl, just walk the other way
- Britannia, almost as good Germany
- Capitalists start rubbing their hands together when they hear `cheap labor`, New crop of kids to indoctrinate this year!
- one of the Greek math teachers, she knows Ziccardi knows a bunch of less than appropriate Greek words, says one in German `don't say that in class`
- You care, I don't care, You Care boxes from entrepreneur, rummaged through the box last year and just said not interested; no dried squirrel, hatchets, nothing of value, overalls, just a box of sugar; things that you shouldn't have had; emailed the principal, cc'd student; physics teacher, remenisced about the scooter girl (she had it taken by the administrators) `she's in a better place now` \\s
- unless something happened, I think Britain is still a consitutional monarchy; Frank no! buy me a Festivus bowl (we have a school one), the queen died; so many new classes and overwhelmed; Principal, approaches Ziccardi at like 10 ft. bad moods
- child labor was still legal in the good old days; he likes the overseer in the background of the factory image; you say sweat shops, I call them opportunities for kids
- Augustus Gloop, the German is sullying the chocolate river (that's all Wonka cares about); that liquid was quite unbearable (1971) what dyes and chemicals needed to create the scene
- Francisco, put crash courses on during class to teach
- 19th century, definitely not now, Britain is a laughing stock rn; piece of lettuce lasted longer than the prime minister; shortest ministership in British history ever; upset that Bojo is gone
- Spielvogel, college professor, has a PhD, taught at Penn State, retired, since book publishing makes more money; any former student that's taken Euro in this building will no this guy; only book ever used, published in 2000 before you even existed; older than most students, in Frank discussion (you must miss him)
- volleyball mania, retired from that many moons ago; for all the non-tenured people; need to make a complete fool of yourself publicly; used to have a faculty team; tradition broken during COVID (people freaking out); played a couple many years ago
- Friday half day, going to watch something about Festivus
- you should not be celebrating, Capitalism!, student vanished, he got sent to the coal mines, the fudge room; who's fault is that (?) take a swig Charlie no one will know; Grandpa Joe almost got him killed
- nearby township, used to be buccolic and cottages; now it's dirty, urbanization, cities, factories
- A skilled artisan sat down and made your computer! \\s (actually made in sweatshops)
- School pride bottle, big shock, is made in China
