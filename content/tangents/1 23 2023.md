- grades actually matter for Marking Period 3 + 4; students must follow the honor code, expectations; kids last period say how teacher can't get a word out; don't be surprised, just like the TBV, what's the word for it? egregious; if we have to sit for an hour-long rant at last faculty meeting, must keep superiors happy, unflinchingly follow orders, get things done; so many teachers in this building **fed up** with how things are happening
- is a man of law, researched code of conduct, right off of our school website; all work must be made up within one week of the student's return to school; the notes in many of the missing assignments `student did not try to make up work`; otherwise the grade will be an `F`
- when we were remote, alot of the policies were forgotten about; policy regarding seniors still exists, if their grade is above 90%, exempt from finals; said that one year and all the sophomores excited (no); had to make that aware to some people who are new in this building who are above me; always explain to your boss how things work
- pajamas myth on the honor code; actually are not allowed by the honor code
- how's your week going? they started talking about how they needed to suspend children; oh really? no these kids are good
- easy grades if you follow rules...
- unless you have a delorian, and go back to the beginning of the 2nd marking period, go back in time to circa October, 2022...
- in some districts, if you don't take the exam, you don't get AP on your transcript; some seniors oblivious, just ignored them; that issue has been floated around for the last 20 years in this building; there literally are certain districts that ignore AP on your transcript from not taking the tests; there certainly aren't any kids in this system milking the system not taking the exam \\s; `that's a laker tradition`; walked out last year ranting about that with the seniors
- there was kid one year, `pajamas are not in the code of conduct`, it's actually right off of the school's website, PDF!; let's take a look, student rights? no; this thing is so outdated, so much that the wrong the wrong bell schedules are on the index, good old days before rotating block schedules; 2:36 vs 2:41 school end, it's a slippery slope!; they did that over the summer, mmm just gonna change the schedule; let's fast forward to page 7, not to look at directions, `very short shorts or pajams are not to be worn at school`, must be removed if requested by staff members; pajama day is illegal!!! weren't even aware that this document existed (new admin); the person who wrote this is long long gone
- all of you who become lawyers, there were always be work, because of **frivolous lawsuits**!
- last year, they didn't tell the faculty they were sending out an email restricting clothing code; `sleeveless tops are prohibited for boys`, `bottoms that exaggerate, emphasize, reveal, or call attention to anatomical details`; I think they were just calling for more lawsuits for this; `slippers, footwear intended for the beach`, banned, what does that even mean?; seniors wrote `no mansplaining` on the board
- doing pretty good with the pacing this year for AP classes, unlike some other classes; Hadjiloucas is still not back; there's a board meeting tonight, ~~which I'm sure you're all gonna be here~~; approved through Friday, might just stop working and need a substitute of nothing goes through; MLEA people will be there this time; last year, no one took a stand on important things (biotech, prom stuff); looked at one of the kids, I didn't know you were such a trouble maker, they smiled and batted their little eyes; ~~protest by students always work, proven time and time again~~; there was the walkout, March 13 2020, t-shirts (`my mom still has one of those t-shirts!`), video, allegedly, of we support... certain things; they all showed up at the meeting last year, forget about anything academic, it was about the prom; day with bunch of sports, people couldn't go, were adamant to not change; some of them got kinda sassy and almost thrown out of the meeting; let me <u>re-explain it publicly</u> 15 times... no I would just take of the tie and start throwing them out
- overalls cost around $100, I can throw money around like that, meanwhile you guys have to work at Walmart; people think our town is quite stuck up, need to hide school pride stuff or else might get accosted
- reading economist articles, probably was wearing a tie, 2010, still had a library and librarian, reading about Putin and Medvedev puppet Russian president
- flex seal, water proof tape, it's kind of expensive, but I can buy it, because I am a teacher, don't worry about what I'm using it for; <u>do not actually write this on an essay</u>
- to reiterate, you will be in college in **seven months**, some schools start in August so it might be **six and a half**
- some kids didn't know what Brexxit was, `Who's Boris Johnson?`, it's like a cubist perspective of boris johnson, fragmented shape, bojo, Brexxit is British Exit (how do kids not know this)
- meme has so many dress code violations, tank top, sunglasses, hat
- Trotsky died accidnetally by falling on an ice pick; had an affair with Frieda Kahlo, an AP Art did the Bolsheviks and their art
- lacks the skill to make memes, just find them on interwebs; just like students in this skill lacking academic skills; kids complaining about being stared at in class `where am I supposed to look?`
- when I was a kid, we didn't play board games, we sharpened sticks and that's all we had, maybe a rock if we were lucky; not making this up, which might be frightening, dodge ball is illegal now in this cupcake generation; back in my day would use extra-inflated kickballs, throw a shot put really far, dodge-ball no problem!; that's why I have arthritis in my throwing arm, dodgeball in 3rd grade; unmistakable sound of over-inflated dodge ball hitting the side of someone's head; do you still play kickball? ~~varsity kickball team in the spring~~; used to give us the same ball during recess, literally told us to just go play; not that many rules, `kill the man with the ball`, kill the carrier, someone running like a Rugby thing, came back from recess with bloody noses, can't say that now, `kill the person`; it was rough; took away the ball during middle school, kept losing it in the woods
- Woody and buzz, circa Toy Story 1, before that they were enemies, then they were friends; now Toy Story 4, they disbanded, people cried, I cheered, `thank god it's gone!`, the best because it can never happen again; he was called `Buzz`, almost like one of the Apollo astronauts was `Buzz Aldrin`
- oxymoron, like literate, respectable, competent students; quadralingual America; video of clueless Americans, literally don't know who the Vice President people, the tide-pod people; Social Darwinism, let it run, it's what we need
- people read back then, when I was a kid, newspapers were published twice a day, that or listened to little orphan Annie on the radio; and if you weren't good, you get your mouth washed out with soap!; Dove is a slap on the wrist, need Irish Spring, or something savage, student: `my aunt uses hot sauce`; so I can straighten you out by randomly pulling out a bar of soap, repressed memories, traumatic... kill the kid with the ball
- life lesson: when things get difficult, just give up and run away; we're playing a team, they're really good, just not gonna show up
- during the weekends just reading Wikipedia to keep up with the kids in US History
- we have this class tomorrow, right after your 54 minute lunch; hope you kids can finish eating in 54-minutes; go through front door to get your `senior surprise!`; now if I said that you would get a bit worried, just gonna give a bar exam!
