title: "1 18 2023"
---
- one of the classes said that we need a mindful minute; i've got a mindful minute on my boot, wanna take a look
- principal walked in during 3rd period, one of the kids asked what `complacent` was; 2nd industrial revolution, how come Germany surpassed Britain (Britain became complacent); 28 sophomores go *what*, that's ironic, had to discuss it; principal just walked out like, *this is good*
- it's 2023, you can't say that, still sticking to my beliefs, seniors in the room, oh you nuisances to society, the chairman of the whatever department, **chair person** or else you get rolled by twitter sjws; they will judge you if you write Ottomen instead of Ottomans
- as witnesses, confiscated the scooter someone broke in; scared he was gonna break the aluminum scooter over my knee, Greek physics teacher wanted it, principal's yelling at her while, `I warned you!`, the kids don't listen
- it's getting real, college might be this year, less than 8 months; I don't know when they start, don't judge, some kid found out where I went to college; that trickster, going to have to kick him off the academic team, leave it on his permanent record; one year, academic team almost lost a question to Black Sabbath and got kicked out
- kids could not get over the fact that one of the contestants was one of my former students, thought that I was almost cool for once; also, said senior was not teaching at this building at that point (Hoffman)
- cos of x, y = -1 instead of -2, think about that (???)
- have cluster of gotos, when in doubt, Ric Flair for president, I'm concerned
- how was gov today, fun? oh you're in for a treat (Francis probably has something going on)
- math, got rid of that yesterday; you know what I don't respect, people that give out information that's a secret and make it public, ... college stuff
- advice : don't do anything offensive this week, you guys are fine, other classes are doing dumb stuff, it's a shame when the grades are due soon, and you can't trust those computers
- real cholera, not like that test cholera, someone being here all day, sign out of school 12:46, back by 1:44, kids used to do that; gee golly, they can get to and get from and get diagnosed and be back in 43 minutes; not to brag, I used to hunt kids in the hallway, they would miss a test in the beginning of the day, would hang out by the art room, hey, how are you, feeling better? here's the test, that was when we first got powerschool, kids could not understand how Chris and I knew where they were (other periods), circa 2013 (when it arrived)
- grateful dead shirt, and now i'm going to go beyond the slide, how weird would it be if I came in wearing a grateful dead shirt; this one is better, it's XL! I would say something, but will be nice and not, something like `I have dignity`
- had certain skills that are no longer useful, like programming a clock on a vcr, you guys will get made fun of when you are older as well, people used to use carrier pigeons, pigeon tastes just like chicken, yeah i'm vegetarian, I eat squirrel, squirrel is actually kosher \\s
- physics is complicated, trust me that's all we need to know, chemistry is complicated, don't need to know what an atom is, can't do that in history, some of the students are very timid, just like me; how does it feel kids, to be talked over; US1 kids got reamed out by their English teacher the period before; it's not you it's me? guess what it's not us
- never got an MLEA room, gotta talk with Francis, oh we're not on speaking terms; I am not walking down there, says he thinks Ziccardi's a nice guy, and that he doesn't know why they disagree
- I know the feeling, every September, inheriting the mess, one year had an AP World test that didn't know what Islam was; vaguely in passing, Islamic history, what's that? how to solve, another reading! always works
- our generation's gift to you kids, it's the national debt! property, the Tourne, McCaffree road, can't miss it make a left, all the tourists were making a left, once they get to 4 corners they stop looking at the livestock, you can't do that, pull over near 4 corners cause a traffic jam, what's wrong with these people, I usually roll down Subaru windows, turn down Black Sabbath, yell at them, city folk and such, wave a fist, crank it up, leave a burnout up the hill, what are these people, have never seen a horse before; `our country house in Aruba`...
- gotta watch what I say to the US1 kids, anything said will just fly over their heads, got the translation thing (sarcasm neon letters)
- there's an old picture of Andrew Jackson with no teeth, any of your neighbors have no teeth? he was in his 70s, literally no teeth, looks a lot older, JQA was the earliest with photographs before him
- last year, when certain kids would say `don't look at me!`, it's because I couldn't see that far, all the kids in the cornered look the same, messing up names, one of the homeless kids in the school (Between 2 Pageants interview), 2 gentleman before school sitting out in the hallway, gee golly I didn't know we have homeless people in the school what happene; say hello to the tent city in California, we all ove camping, just not urban camping; we are camping rn, probably have fire going right now on the homestead, got the teriyaki squirrels ready
- wake up call is kids realizing their situation (academics), when you get humiliated, need to process what happened, History Bee, Sports, Academics... I don't know what it's called
- Jack Lamberg, he would probably eat Tom Brady today, don't show kids after school, they'll get scared since he has no teeth.
- smurfs? they're good people, Karl Marx, cartoons are not just cartoons, let me just say this, utopian socialism, that's what they are, kids shows are not just kids shows, they live in mushroom houses, that sounds like a grateful dead album; confused with word serf
- historical books have a thesis, and then they have to prove this thesis, you'll learn this in about 7-8 months when you get only a week to read one of them
- don't get me wrong, don't go home and start talking bad about the wizard, epic Album 1 for Black Sabbath, should be our school anthem; discovered the button when they rediscovered the button,  there's a picture of me near the button with a line through it, a little heavy metal between classes to get the kids moving
- parents say, you gotta go to school today, the easy way or the hard way, walk out of your room down the spiral staircase past 2 chandeliers, take credit card for lunch money; hard way, you get pulled out from under your bed by the ankle even if you're 18, get thrown into the tractor, parents use good cop bad cop, which one is which? you guys going he's right! easy way hard way, do you ever use that with the kids, do you expect them to do stuff by the time the parents are back? put the kid in the room, shut the light shut the door, sayonnara; get ear plugs; shut the door and don't go back in there, think about what I would do (nailing the door with a 2x4) don't be weak
