- a 2nd grader, or half the people in this building don't know that the statue of liberty is not a real person
- if you look closely, there's a riot going on and cars being burnt down
- really it is? the kids are lazy, good point colleague. *sarcasm light*
- if you ever need a weapon, use cobblestones
- if you manage to find yourself in the wrong AP test, maybe you shouldn't be taking AP tests; not that I haven't witnessed it... in university; realize half an hour into the course that you are in the wrong course, do you stand up and leave to get made fun of, or just sit through it; college professors call you by your last names, disrespect (compared to administrators); in the building or in the army they just call you by your last name
- we're at the end of the marking period, gave advice to idiot kids who did stupid things during this week; don't upset the teachers, they have very short memories \\s
- the kids don't believe in capitalization; we are doomed in this class due to the absence of formal writing skills; all the kids are used to typing in lowercase; the sophomores don't actually learn English in the class
- never signed the waiver, showed naked woman (painting) in class, going to get emails this week
- pesky, causing problems, like the freshman in this building, causing fistfights; last period, we do not condone violence \\s; in math class, there was a fist fight, it's the math teacher's fault for repressing the kids; could probably get the kids off legally, `it's my client, the kids, not their fault for being repressed`, there have been fistfights over the year, they are rare, usually knee deep in breaking up; last time it was around the same vicinity in the math wing; walking down the hallway, kids stop and form a circle, there was a bit of "fistocuffs", sweet Chris and I were there, took a kid by the neck pushed them into locker and told them to calm down; it's not cool, 2 o'clock on a Friday, now I know why you hate the administrators so much; one of the kids was on quizbowl team and got suspended, Krause broke it up; don't keep up with school gang fights in Morris County; video of kid breaking a vending machine somewhere else; there were no phones back then, issue with America, instead of breaking it up, grown adults take out their phones and start recording fights; did not get hit with collateral damage back then, quick on their feet, it wasn't much of a fight, kids nowadays don't know how to fight, when I was a kid...
- if you wanna find trouble go to a major University campus, like in Southern California, Berkely, burn stuff for fun (administration wanted them to wear shoes or something), literally burned down part of the campus; violence felt good, but next week straight up were missing some buildings in the college; if you get angry and wanna protest something, go to Parhills, we'll still have some of our campus on Monday; at one point they staged a thing where no one wore clothes for one day, because they were against the dress code; will think differently after getting tetanus from getting stabbed by a nail; `who here has gotten tetanus?` it's a myth, just like bigfoot
- sibling of a student last year, sibling joined a sorority, went to tell papa, was Peter aware of this? oh I don't know about that; would highly dissuade from joining a sorority or fraternity; some of you are smiling, see you know what I'm talking about;
- there's a test today, test cholera, I know it well, we used to have outbreaks of it, it's been a while; it's whenever there's a test scheduled, the same kid is out every time; another sub variant is `Block 1 is the test and feels so much better Block 2`; teacher gave a test Period 4 back in the day, this block period trash didn't exist, signs out for Period 3 (doctors appointments) and come back Period 5; who are these doctors you can get to and from, get back by 45 minutes? praise the lord you are back from your doctor's appointment, `test cholera`
- at least the German fraternities have goals, unlike the fraterneties of today
- was it a test, or a senior moment? incorrect date on the TBV (canvas)
- tried to cheer up Francisco today, didn't work, made fun of his hat this morning, if it makes you feel better; gee golly, college, wish I went, then walked away
- don't want to brag, might have been part of secret police, but can't tell you since it's a secret
- Berkely, walk to class barefoot, since it's sunny Southern California; if you do that in Michigan, you'll get frostbite
- sorry I stole your classmates candy stash yesterday, then threw back the parts I didn't like; student got it from Ms. Adams room
- Elvis' daughter died today, just learned, like that gang fight; please let me know if Britain is still a constitutional monarchy, not sure since I'm not like other teachers, checking their twitter feeds in class
- you know those kids, who have a trust fund and Mercedes since their parents work hard, even though they've never worked a day in their life
- I should go down to guidance; I forgot to go over a whole week of stuff Betsy; get a lollipop and close the door
- Francisco, film Friday, I'm worried, he's given up, this isn't good
- don't need emails about sexism, and women not being able to vote **historically**, no emails (or gang fights) please, it's Friday; you hear me yelling, I had hall duty today, ironically was near Chris' room, which is in the vicinity of the fight; which isn't funny because now it's real; where have we slipped?
- World kids don't know what entrepreneur is, even though they are in those courses; might have gone into a whole Marxist rant on the kid
- the candy stash, leprechaun's cauldron with a mouse trap to catch kids in; chilling in art while listening to Bob Dylan?; she's not happy when kids walk out, but you do it anyways, don't respect us
- NJEA don't bring that up at home, oh god those people, that's why our taxes are so high
- Pinkertons, not to brag, but on my Common App, got an internship with them one summer, strike breaker, had a whole nametag and outfit, broke up the Haymarket riot
- going to have to do my taxes soon, which I urge you all to do, tax evasion is a crime; union dues are not a donation, can't write that down; bring that up to Francisco, the whole 54 minutes will be blown, don't say that I told you; he will talk about it for 54 minutes easy, can just put your pens away and pack up, sit back and relax
