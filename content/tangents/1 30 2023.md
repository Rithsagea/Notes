- it sounds like you've heard a rant some time; if you call Doc Mr. you will get yelled at; `a young PhD student who can't find a job so has to drive` scenario on Econ test, Doc actually drives Uber for extra money
- didn't assign stuff, executive decision to go over stuff in class
- out because had Malaria, canned squirrel botulism theory (offensive, no one eats non GMO canned squirrel)
- *Mangili walks in then swiftly leaves*
- never give up never surrender, never compromise, mercy is for the weak, sweep the leg, you know the rules, with a bunch of 4y/o's, student body? never!
- today things change! I come in and am a lot calmer, random rant of importance of hyphen in Austria-Hungary
- everyone happy / productive in my absence (?)
- rules for everyday are on the board, just a date card with `Arbeit` for every single day, means to work, it's been there for decades
- you make bad decisions, you get overthrown, it's your fault, `them's the breaks`, that's like college, crying in October because you're on your own; sending emails to teacher `I'm Dying`, it's just the usual you were right, it's a lot of work, I'm dying
- remember the kids I had to explain 3 branches and Cabinet last week; they couldn't understand Henry Cabbot Lodge + Republicans didn't ratify treaty because League of Nations; went over this 15 times, it was even the book, didn't infer that they could read / want to read; literally failing, wrote that the treaty wasn't ratified because it was too harsh on Germans (what)
- learned about the ideology of Botulism; anarchism, liberalism, botulism; **do not write that on the unit test** botulism was the most important ideology in the 20th century
- promising vs following through; like kid promising to parents things will change, begging and pleading on their hands and knees; will it actually happen?
- Fernando Raymos put up signs with all the Rooms (eagle project), it's like there's an emergency, don't know your room number, can look at it and know; do parents make kids leave with a nametag that says `if lost, return to ...`; another thing years ago, they put in stickers that you can see room number on the outside, after certain things happened in America (Columbine... probably idk); When Francisco talks about being safe in the bunker, look out there; why do I have to stare at a brick wall for 30 years, for being sassy, look at what they did!; the auditorium wasn't already there, they built it to spite me, block my view; I could do like a mural / graffiti art; Liberty Leading the People
- faculty meeting, phone use is out of control, preaching to the choir, then point 2 -> we have no money, apparently the librarians were costing too much
- if you ever need a weapon, rip up a cobblestone, chuck it at a cop car; I don't wanna brag, but every time I see Gill, I ask can I ride shotgun? he's never said no!; on the PA when kid gets pulled over, `I told you! Comply!`; for a fee, I'll be lawyer, not to step on toes; put on a tie; not that they wait for the kids at lunch, and kids get pulled over; watch your speed on Morris Avenue, go up and down the hill with your parking brakes
- May 5th is around the corner, college is around the corner; it'll be warmer, and free on a campus to make good decisions; will be back if you don't make good decisions
- boy I wish I was smart enough to teach the Holocaust course
- America is indivisible under god, justice for all, Hallelujah, country being divided is not good
- infamous, that's me in this school, they all know who I am, don't even have the kids, people go up to me and say "hey!" i don't know who you are; they speak and I walk away
- had malaria, hallelujah, power of church of metal, overcame malaria, ~~because we have so many mosquitos in january~~; sophomores just nod and agree, say a word in Germany, they don't know; I gestured towards kid at TBV, then said a word in Italian
- I ain't got time to write, don't take tests, read, don't have pen or pencil, write everything in expo, can't fill out a scantron like me, not a good role model like me!
- one of the kids realized Paris tree-line is why Boulevard is named as it is; patted kid on the head, and called them something in German I cannot say
- adolescent obesity, #1 in teen pregnancies, basketball invented in America at least, was a real basket, no hole in the bottom; peach basket, indoor gym teacher invented it cuz kids had nothing to do
- 90% of you guys have indoor plumbing, other people still have outhouses, just take tractor and move it if you need; it's still there because nostalgia, just like Laker Pride bumper sticker; I'm being nice...promise
- don't get overwhelmed,  take a deep breath
- traffic in Rome is awful, drive in tiny cars, ignore stop signs; Rome literally still looks like Rome under the Romans, it's a free for all in Italy, not a city person, don't know where anything is, couldn't drive in NYc, let alone Rome; I've never driven in NYC in my life, being serious, because I'm not crazy; this is America, we don't believe in trains! we don't ride bikes, it's not Dutchland! public transport, this is America, land of the free, home of the brave, monster trucks, 4 wheel drive!
