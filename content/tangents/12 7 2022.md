- Previous history teacher gave simplified, abridged lessons, had to unteach all the kids
- Use Roman numerals rather than numbers for monarch's names in AP FRQs. The graders will judge you, and our school. To the `innocent little sophomores`. will become cynnical after having Ziccardi for 4 years.

- If you don't know what hedonistic means, ask someone else
- *Art History Tangent* I can't spell these names; Is it wrong to give uneducated opinion about art
- He was a tyrant, like Stalin; That was disrespectful, Stalin actually got stuff done, kid's weren't late to school 8:05 under him; there were other things he was involved in that we don't talk about.
- "I don't want ot read don't make me read" dragging kid down the hall by foot, forcing them to read textbook

- We have slide for economics, because might not be familiar with it, (disrespect)
- deficit spending is highlighted, thank god that's not a problem nowadays in America; don't have a 30 trillion dollar deficit in America; kid goes why not just print more money; someone says fed chairman is the president; America has very promising future; pushing kids to Francis' direction, is dumping unqualified kids; like inheriting children from world cultures; i got A+, cheated whole year, look at my transcript; in day and a half, immediately realize differences.
- Francis rant: if you aren't get a 4 and a 5, don't even bother taking the exam, bunch of kids in the past got 1s lol
- I could teach you economics, and stats, brought up a graph of deficit spending and correlation. kagliati isn't here half the time, so could take over the class

- pull out your calculators, gotta get them to warm up, literally type in "Versaille Cost"
- French and Indian War, who won (bunch of south asians beat the french!); politically incorrect; wasn't in charge of teaching that, whoever was teaching US1; thank god US helped the French back when they needed help in revolution; sophomores truly believe WWIII exists in the course, very clueless "Oh, Ok *writes it down*"
- you know that feeling, America, Greece, the Italians (all broke)
- Economically there are conditions that need to be fullfilled for a country to go bankrupt; we aren't in a recession because we said so (economists go brr); just going to leave it at that, don't want to ruin the day anymore
- prediction :: US is going to go bankrupt by Jan 2023
- Sit around and talk about how you feel by the end of the day; the sophomores would close their notebooks `Great, we're done!`

- Need to write a European History textbook over the summer
- the following meme is on the dark web, the dark black web, i didn't make this up; tangent on this meme; wait your dad likes Dio, but also is interested in the same meme template; what do you usually eat Saturday, need to join Ziccard
- copy machine so old can't put images on them, very hard to test art history \\s
- you'll be home by 6 at dinner, kids believed Estates General was 1 day long; you sully this place! is it wrong to yell this at a kid in the hallway

- Books kids, books, art!
- we're going no where (came to that realization somewhere in building ~12:45)
- send Scooby and Shaggy to investigate why door was mysteriously locked (Tennis Court Oath) it was old man Withers (no adult overtones at old, children's show \\s); ah, cool, they're always hungry always driving around in a van; beat neck hippies, Shaggy needs a shave, that's why he's "shaggy", bell bottoms, for god's sake
- most of you have indoor tennis court at home, west wing, next to observatory, Professor Plum with candle stick
- "thank god artist was there to capture it there" Tennis Court Oath,  when Washington crossed the Delaware, British shot people; they just lined up and shot innoccents; dog survived and told the story, trust the dog, not the cat
