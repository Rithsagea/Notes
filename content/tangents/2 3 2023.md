- one day after school. in the lobby, they came up to me and went `we never thought we would say this, but we miss you, had no idea how good we had it`; just go `heh`; Francis admitted to knowing only how to teach Latin, and I would even disagree with that
- psychology, econ, it's all social science, theoretically...; in college you're going to need to take psychology, omigosh it's february, in 6 or 7 months, seniors, Louiseberg PA maybe, going to be free to make your own decisions, mom isn't going to wake you up every morning to go to class; the truth about college, we're making it a week long thing in the side lot when it's warmer; each session is $100 cash, bring a lawn chair, township kids bring a tree stump
- today is not yesterday, welcome to now... the future
- ego keeps the student body in check, keeps the Mountaineer in check; you know they sent us... hallmark of capitalism in work again; gotta buy a card, oh, it must mean you don't care; lets be honest, we could care less about it; people know that I'm gonna rant, waste of money and time; I know you're going to make a collage of construction paper stuff this weekend, not to judge what you do on the weekend with your mediums; work with elmer's glue popsicle sticks and cotton balls; Greeks worked in marbles sometime, not to judge; finger paint action!; I'm sure it was not your decision to send it out, other people on the Mountaineer; they've never done that
- there's that word, expectations, you love that word; pajamas.. flipflops; you can't look at me; oh we're going back to that last year? this is America, my class, can do whatever I want; don't tell me I can't threaten you with this stapler, slowly walked over -> sophomore this morning; sat on table and kept flourishing it like a quickdraw... holster for the stapler; the kid couldn't focus, ended up in the wellness room, wonder why
- there's an AP Psychology class in America, was just discussing this in America; it's in the course of studies and we've never run it; almost like we keep throwing up the same thing and nothing changes; we've never run it, ever
- I don't wear a coat, I walked in like this from the teachers lounge; one morning it was this cool, I'll just say one of the teachers rolled in with their respectable minivan, no offense I know you love your minivan; I'm walking in a couple of weeks ago, made a point of rolling down their window and asking where my coat was; I was nice, could have said many things, `thanks mom, I don't need one!`; urriola... she's the coat police? always wiping your little noses and making sure your book bags are packed; 16 degrees out... think they said that in Omaha Beach? and also not to say it... lets be honest, days like today are why we spent the summer splitting wood
- other people, doing what they want, saying what they want; ... we're talking about psychology; what's that supposed to mean? I'm a simple person; you're in a ... I almost called it a school, a building right now; you're sad right now; that would be an offensive to daycares; you guys are acting like 4th graders, oh wait that would affect 4th graders to put kids like you on their level; you're all conscious and aware right now, stomachs filled with kraft mac and cheeses in sugar; you're definitely not aware of all the `get under the chair, soviets!` or `alphabetical seating throughout the years!`; thank you, now you know why I don't like certain kids, right off the bat, because of the last name
- I make fun of them mercilessly... that doesn't narrow it down
- college is fun, if you don't get a syllabus day 1 be worried, they can make up whatever you want, the man, ironically was a classics professor; got so upset on week 3, made up an attendance policy on the fly, if you're out 2 times, automatically fail the semester; they ironically... futilely, unbeknownst to them, took the midterm already took the midterm and failed the time; sadistically watched them take the midterm and final, wasting their time; there was no recourse, got an F, no `mommy emails the school` or something; you're in college, 18 for the most part, can also get arrested, throw that in the risk, I bet you get that alot `if you get arrested I won't bail you out again!`
- that's how we do things, expo! do you have a pen? here's the problem, I don't take tests, when I write I write in expo marker
- have I ever ranted or yelled that we're doomed in this country? that's where I get the idea from; Europe is less doomed, but everywhere is doomed; Germany vs one of the places in Italy; it's because of Silvio Berlusconi; what do you think of Merkel... don't answer, plead the 5th; you should answer like a lawyer `what do you think?`; it's cold tomorrow, you'll be outside, make a little campfire burning your stock certificates; other groups, we have wood and wood piles
- soviets used to call us <u>decadent</u>, the soviets are usually right!; idle and rich... know anyone like that no idea... ~~rich people? don't know any~~
- individuals in society incapable of creativity, lemme prove to you that this is true, this is a subrant; *Karate Kid + Willy Wonka* remakes; 1984, how dare you, I know what you're saying even though I've never seen it; Red Dawn was remade, what else... Top Gun; you're in charge of twitter updates, Mr. Miyagi has died, pretty sure the Queen died in this class; again, alert me when important people
- back in the day, when you promote mediocrity, there's a problem; now that's what everything is, that's America! I don't know if any of you by chance ~~this might be rare~~, if you do sports around here, I actually accosted a kid....; you got nothing back in the day... you showed up, did nothing, kept the bench nice and toasty; nobody really cares; ah those tokens, I'll put it in your college application in 12 years, scan it and send it to Stanford
- please tell me you didn't get the tattoo `God is dead`; it's too late, once you're sitting in the chair and you paid the money... cash; not literally... like your goldfish is dead, it's actually dead; going to be hard digging the whole; just throw it in the trash; have some respect for the goldfish; down the toilet; not everyone has one of those... outhouses
- you know you've made it when you are on a German stamp, no offense, but American stamps ~~also have important people~~ like the Simpsons... Mickey Mouse; not to keep saying it, but we used to have a stamp club... circa 2006; later in time we had a Seinfeld club; how many of you would join that? no offense but it's not worth it; yea we'll open it up to parents; used to be huge on clubs, ping pong club;... certain administrators... kids lost interest; Mangili cancelled the table
- it's getting philosophically deep today, bordering life lessons
- hate to spoil it uhh... the Nazis lost; Nietzsche's stuff was vague and ambiguous; student: like the bible; homework for the weekend, find value in a valueless world; is it under here? nope, collegiate dictionary, property of the English dictionary; I don't think we have one; that's a religion, worshipping sarcasm; what you gonna worship a pencil? `#concerned`; I don't have friends, don't have peers (all dead because old); don't read media or culture, don't believe in government; not conditioned at all!
