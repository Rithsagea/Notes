- don't put ketchup on squirrels, paprika and teriyaki is fine; roasting squirrels is pretty fast, there isn't much meat there
- kids got a skating rink in property, all the rain froze over, only melted 2 days ago; 2 inches of ice, 4 meters across
- Western Union still exists, for money; first job interned on a stage coach, literally road shotgun; back in the day, American idiomatic expressions, stagecoaches were very common as form of travel (like Cinderella) rider with reigns on left, person sitting on right (passenger seat on car) btw there were no cars, called riding shotgun because it was so dangerous, bandits rob people inside, ride holding a shotgun for protection (preferrably 12 gauge); people were paid in cash, try to rob it on paydays; hate people in historical places, they don't break character (what's the time? what's a watch?)
- Colonial Williamsburg, it's way too hot, (is it always this hot, no you're lucky, 3 hottest days of the year) wanna go see Yorktown? No!!!; didn't visit history because know the history rather than toursists, air conditioned; go past the door and walk out into the jungle, 100% humidity for 3 days
- have digital thermometer at home, 0 degrees flat, -7 with wind chill; I live in Norway, Canadian time (which one); China only has 1 timezone, pretty big country; Spain on German time zone, it was changed and they never bothered to change back; Franco is in the middle of fascist rulers
- didn't have thermoplastics in 1838, first Transatlantic cable broke off, just put another one down, planned obsolesence; parts of them wash up on beaches of Cape Cod, historical footmark; state of the art in 1858
- "there's no reading this week!", I've got bad news, and bad news
- surplus, bad word in business; building rail lines is really hard work, need to blow through mountain range
- Delaware Water Gap is controversial current event; want to fix twisted roads, fighting over whether it should be allowed, rocks fall down with massive fences
- map of Europe, and completed rail lines; random shapes, ink blot test? look how industrialized Spain and Italy are (Spain isn't even on the map and Italy doesn't exist); lucky you are still there Ottamens; Buda and Pest (boy that's 2 cities? who knew)
- Whales, the West Virginia of Britain, known for coal mines, good people, they speak Welsh (dying language)
- America has census data every 10 years, ever since 1790; got Census hw first week out from online work; government pretty much gives parents homework, scantron with bubbles; some Americans threw it out, someone will literally go to your house; July 2020, a car pulls up onto the Homestead (big nono) it's a Prius (those people aren't from around here); guy got about 10 ft up the driveway, wearing overalls, just raise hand up and gesture to stop; hire college students to follow up on people who didn't fill in the census; the people live across the road didn't fill census; don't know who they are, leave, *pulls axe from behind legs*, they left, shifted into reverse real quick
- Francis, 2023; any predictions? Putin's going to kill himself in a bunker, it will be specifically Ziccardi's bunker; allegedly on the dark web, when alleged war broke out in Ukraine, put a price on Putin's head to take him out
- Pittsburgh, Cleveland Ohio, Rust Belt, back in the day when we didn't outsource everything
- Jaguar back in the 80s, XJ8, v12, good luck changing spark plugs, reaching, hoods were massive since engines were so big; didn't have heated seats, all wheel drive, Judas Priest speakers with subwoofer
- Birmingham is the birth place of heavy metal (Black Sabbath); name of band came from horror movie that was playing in cinema; horrible polluted industrial town; music had to be distorted, Tony Iommi + Ozzy, at factory, sheet metal press, severed part of two of his left fingers; thought his career was over, detuned and distorted his guitar because of industrial accident
- latest Mountaineer video, only showed part of it, interviewed a lot more people, had to corner Fusco in his office, Ayhan's interview, very interesting; who likes the American Pageant in the first place? it's garbage, between 2 Spielvogels is more interesting; interviewed Merrit, what's your favorite cookie?, riveting questions; walk down there (how did you get a whole room?) used to be for special education offices, now it's his room (what is this a playground?); should turn library to heavy metal museum, no one uses it; horrid Option 2 Study Hall with seniors last year; can't even think about this kids, going to have a flashback
- the random "my kids failing" email, got progress report, just delete that email
- back in the 80s, personal computers, that's a fad, those will never catch on; we don't care about the people who make bad decisions, we care about the winners in history, literally made computers and circuits in their garage
- Apple proprietary software, graphical user interface first, every classroom had computers with dust jacket in the corner, had to type in commands, hit enter, if misspelled or syntax error, would just not work
- People think Ford invented the car, 1880s Germans actually invented, only rich people could own them; only people that worked on Wall Streets in the 80s could afford cell phones, didn't even work, cost like 6 grand something ridiculous; if really fancy, had a car phone with a cord; VCRs used to be $700; the one we have, is a VCP, can play, not record
- kid that was falling asleep "found" it, almost tried to steal a piece of paper; just tired, because of a week off
