---
- `Welcome to the Jungle` crank that in the front lot every year; by the time I hit the Boulevard, I start blasting `Highway to Hell`, previous song I play while walking into the school; it gets worse here every single time; people drive crazy speed on Morris, be careful
- I think Francis lives in the town; he doesn't seem like (no offense) township; wanted to buy solar panels but there are too many trees; call me up! I'll come down and cut them down for free; work for wood! I think that's the new contract, get wood, might get some extra hay!
- there's a tailgate to start the school  year off, you guys aren't invited to it, since it is faculty only; one year literally thought that the Berlin Conference image was people just tail gaiting to kickoff the "Scramble for Africa"; extra concerned
- I know to you guys 30 years is a long time, none of you guys are 30 years yet
- after school, this place clears out like rats from a ship in 7 minutes, like Colosseum in Roman times; I feel like if I want down to the lobby and threw a box of money up, you guys would just ignore it
- in the cafeteria, a kid dropped a dollar on the floor, literally counted how many kids stepped over the dollar; next day, put down a five, it took a $100 bill for someone to bend over and pick the money up
- get senior privilege revoked due to your behavior in lunch, blame Europe; could sense sadness, glum seniors last year; they got extra agitated because they have to eat lunch in the office, and aren't allowed to go out now; they did it last year when the kid sassed them, the entire room in the office was filled with seniors who couldn't leave by the end of the year; they're starting to do it again, if you cause problems; they mean business, it's like good cop bad cop, I'm the good cop; forget about eating lunch outside, you'll be eating lunch with your lunchbox; one of the parents collected lunchboxes, gave me an 18 lunchbox from 1983
- do teachers come and they hug you? it's weird! my job in the home stead is shovel control; also someone ran over the cat, (reason student asking teacher for a hug); someone was crying because of this; what do parents tell you when your pet dies? now you know what's out there, that's why there's all this space in the courtyard; is it still there let me get a shovel; I'm not squeamish; she was almost crying because I wouldn't hug her; students have hugged me at the end of the year...awkwardly; someone came in end of last year, was so sad, I was just standing there, was like "just go, leave..." that was rough, sad that someone allegedly ran over a cat
- Cecil Rhodes on his surfboard; some kid thought he was Hitler (why is Hitler on the screen); what happened to this place? no offense
- a kid thought the Delaware water gap was in Delaware (because the Delaware river goes through Delaware) don't try to process it you'll get a headache
- TR, you dropped your glasses! was there at San Juan Hill! \\s; did you know Roosevelt, one of his only faults was that he was ridiculously near-sighted, if he didn't have glasses on, he wasn't functional; when he led the charge, he was carrying like 8 spare pairs of glasses; when you are in battle and your glasses fly off, you can't just look for it; they didn't have LASIK back then
- was that the cat? someone freaked out; one of the kids in our classes made a joke and they were crying; normally don't feel bad, felt bad for her; Buckley said how she once fried her cat in her engine once; driving and heard the cat screaming, squirrels do that, mice; if you park your car too long and live in the middle of no where, establish a nest; mice will go under the hood and chew through the plastic; the chemical they use in their wire insulation attracts rodents, everything is chewed and the car doesn't start
- we had a stamp club, did chess, why not, had a Seinfeld club one year, and now it's a dead art, like writing in cursive, little kids can't read it anymore, it's like Polish (because they do not teach it); or Linear A, like the Aegeans
- luckily for them, they died and didn't have to deal with stuff, I say that a lot
- some of the biology teachers are less than competent (student remark); apparently one of the faculty left and I didn't know; they don't let me out of my cage here! I didn't even know what his first name was
- hopefully you didn't do a whole unit on Social Darwinism and do labs...
- I have 2 cricket bats, where is he? hey kids I'll be there in a minute! pop up and covered in dirt; was proctoring one of Sikha's finals, and there's loads of fun stuff, was just walking around with a shovel, as the kids were walking around trying to take their final; couldn't focus
- I busted his chops so much, Where's your shirt!; ehhhhh; crazy that Ziccardi's wearing the shirt; that's the turning point; they're stalling it out until they've agitated someone on a list
- i'm sorry if you've heard this before, pull your weight at home, or what have you contributed, or you can't even handle a shovel
- tomorrow I'll be wearing my Luddite t-shirt; will just be a picture of someone smashing a laptop
- this was simpler times before the world fell apart; goes back to videos of Americans being clueless; Tide Pods (social Darwinism at its finest!), I know they look like candy, I ranted that week about how if you're 17 years old, and you think it's a good idea to eat those laundry bits... you are a hindrance, laissez-faire; Tide had to take the coloring out
- Mountaineer, camera person told me that you guys are coming back whole circle; no one wants to hear him! actually you are right
- ranted about tide pods for at least a week, will parley this advice: `don't do anything dangerous just so it's on social media and you get likes... you will die`; woman wanted more likes, so she went to the Bronx zoo and climbed into the tiger pit, friend videoed her, it was in the zoo for a week, why would anyone do this? the lion's reaction... it could not process that a person had climbed into their pit; not a good idea; you can't make this up; she put it up on social media, cops didn't know about it; legal advice: cops monitor social media; she was arrested and charged for this which is illegal, can't climb into a lion pit at a zoo; ended up in jail
- someone pulled over for K-turning through traffic on Main Street, police was right there (what are you doing); Biotech kid
- problem with America, don't say hey stop that; just stop and film a video; hypothetically, if a gang fight broke out at a sporting event... remember you are always being recorded, if you start a gang fight at a sports ball event.. allegedly I heard that the parents from the other team was the biggest problem... someone's mother allegedly was cheering them on
- pointed out a joke answer to student; referred to `Indian Industrial Revolution` they couldn't even look at me...said on Twitter now, I chose the joke answer; is going to be trending; like `Spielvogel did not address` and `Europe cared about the poor because it was Christian`
- students are inherently lazy + apathetic
- one year took the SAT, one of the vocab words and only reason they knew the word `apathetic` was because I called them that the entire year
- why no t-shirt for him today? he's our leader... allegedly
- is this last year all over again, like I can't look at students anymore? they sat in a row; listen... this is my class, I can do whatever I want, or I'll take your scooter; and then they got busted later in the day by the principal; I couldn't see that far, since you sat so far away
- when you grovel or beg for god knows what to your parents... probably everything; need to develop a work ethic
- just say no to kids, unless you want free labor... got a homestead
- the failsafe was the smothering children, best contraception! \\s Egyptians, Greeks, also had attempts at contraceptives... did it work? not really; over time the advent of birth control pills and things.. expect that you will know
