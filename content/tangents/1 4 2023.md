title: "1 4 2023"
---
- rubber door stops were removed, since states decided they were illegal; now states want people to keep doors open, so wooden door stops, giant pile of them; Frank, just drop one off out of the box, I know how to do it; can't do it; laws being followed in this town?; never did fire drills, which were allegedly illegal; this was changed after `certain people are no longer with us`; it's a really nice day out, would be a good day for us to have a fire drill
- spring track, long time ago; it would always be lightly snowing; clueless kids showed up in shorts and froze (the track was still a mudfield)
- is it true they didn't always have recycling in the past?; incoming 3 hour rant
- cholera, do not drink water that has not been boiled, that's why Europeans drink more alcohol than Americans; sanitation, what's that?
- present tense, vs pretorate; World kids this morning had conversation of what this school used to be; teary eyed + nostalgiac, blackboards instead of projectors; kids asked how to show maps and art, needed slide projector, book gave slide set thicker than the book; became obsolete after powerpoint; worst thing was running out of chalk
- a kid one year had a summer house in the Poconos; it was next to where Mr. Merritt lived; we used to be neighbors; used to carpool with Merritt many moons ago, when his boys were much younger; Lancaster, near border of Maryland, it's all just flat farm land there; Pennsylvania is a big state, larger than Hungary
- Omish are good people, no commuting, hustle, community; they do use trucks for business sometimes (exceptions), I wonder what their view of IKEA is, those swingsets in town are probably made by the Omish; next weekend, putting up a pole bar, area is a lot flatter, easier to farm unless you are the Inca, terrace farming;
- kids in the SGA would have "Chinese Elections"; would have speaches, but only like 1 kid one run; college resume, that's the make or break; guidance had to admit that colleges didn't care about the NHS; induction ceremony used to be in the day, couple principals ago, would have the ceremony Friday half day before Memorial Day weekend; invited parents, grandparents, members of the community, board members; they would make speaches as tradition; never pre-read what the kids would read out for speaches; all the speaches were inappropriate, and they didn't even stop it; just sitting there looking at colleagues, wondering if they were hallucinating; blatantly inappropriate, not even innuendo anymore, massive fallout, kids threatened with expulsion, parents lawyered up; one of the advisors walking around the building screaming at kids like they were having a meltdown; nothing actually happened, just stopped doing those speaches; circa 2009; Wallace would probably remember, sweet sweet Chris, bunsen burner guy; Blood was here as well; there were innocent parents and grand-parents sitting around wondering what was going on; was a spectator; kids thought they could get away with murder, `we don't have kids like that anymore without respect for school, faculty, community, BOE, parents, grandparents, ancestors, new immigrants during the gilded age` \\s
- forgot membership, house UnAmerican activities card; Joe McCarthy was just misunderstood, something something Luddites; America society of IPad carrying kids, keep attention of children; when I was a kid, we had a DS, you don't know how good you had it switch kids, not as strong, you aren't that old yet
- `Modern Homesteading`, that's mandatory reading for next week; have a chainsaw, kids on cover only has hacksaw; kid looks miserable, while parents are excited about suspenders and work gloves, denim head to toe; like a flux capacitor from 1830, brought him back; overalls + 2 chickens are better than suspenders; a lot of them just hate city life, just move out to South Dakota; these people are New Yorkers moving out to romantic idyllic life; like Jamestown, don't even survive the first Winter; farming is no longer profitable, agribusiness, farming might seem idyllic, buccolic as livelihood, it is brutal; dairy farmers horrible work; students gonna go home today `college? you know what I'm just going to be come a homesteader`
- Francis teaches at Montclair state; kids who can't write 7 page philosophy should just be construction workers; literally had a toddler meltdown today, before was just pulling ramen out of a box
- kids don't know when this town was founded; don't know history
- poor weren't given college, or color before ... date, made mistake of making fun of school district `that's where my mom works!`, destitute, that's what you would call the neighbouring town; had to go really far out to not get emails from parents
- Banana Republic, at the gap, the mall; can't say that anymore would get cancelled
- historically, this town would use 334, 335, 331 home phone numbers; one year looked at bill, wondering why they were paying for phones; gone; if you need to talk to me come find me
- the best worst movie, Troll 2, documentary was made about it, there are no trolls in it, they are goblins; considered the worst movie 80's horror movie; parents probably have seen it; Charlie chocolate factory, grandfather was a scam artist; entire life just looking into candy shop; is the candy jar half full or half empty; there are literally film studies and dissertations of this film; post AP exam content; Oompa Loompas, they identify as such, don't know, didn't say anything
- don't have time / luxury to read; one of the seniors last year for 4 years, wrote a very nice card and gave Ziccardi book and wrote a little note June 2022; thank your parents a lot, but ironically will never have the time to read; son can't read, 2 people faster than 1 person cutting wood
- if you go to college, which I do not advise, when you take history or political science, need to "The Communist Manifesto"; AJP Taylor, almost Howard Zinn level
- gave kids a handout, the sophomores freaked out since was passing stuff out, started putting things away and taking out pencils; who are you? (confused since normally only passed out assessments)
- just read Communist Manifesto off of [marxist.com]
- don't teach at Wildwood anymore, Thomas Jefferson with world kids, got to Haitain revolution, brought up natural rights as a concept, plagiarized off of John Lock, Willy Wonka scam artist
- 1997 Festivus episode, won the feats of strenght and aired spreadsheet google docs of grievances, is not damning evidence, admissable in court but not a problem; Seinfield episode Cramer becomes mall Santa Claus and becomes a Marxist; no one watches Seinfeld, just wasting my time; Seinfeld allegedly dated a 16 year old when he was 30
- lets not be part of the problem lets be part of the solution, spiel since marking period ending soon and kids don't have any work turned in (lol)
