- Pensyltucky is 17, 18, NJ is 07; As I write on all  those college recommendations, don't even need to mention "Road" at end of street name.
- Point 1: kids are on their phones too much, yes sir, we'll crack the whip; affects the science people, need their bunsen burners and beakers
- People have work here that is due on Friday; it's Festivus Friday, very bad waow; poor poor Betsy taken advantage of 5 ft through a window, making up names like "Frank", proposed kiosks, and they just went no; the day informally, he sat down and went "we're not expanding the cafe"
- Kids had free time (could ask siblings), would probably hold it over you; back in my day, we had free time; lobby there were tables and chairs like cafe, high school nearby probably bought them at a garage sale.
- dirty, unfettered, entrepneural, capitalism
- another great day for school, we realized the merchandized school water bottles are made by little children in China; mass-produced, gave a kid somewhere in the world a job
- last year, doing outsourcing in World; take off your shoes kids! they aren't made in America; *everyone just taking off shoes and checking*
- In June, was judged, because the kids asked if he wore shorts, don't own sandals, shorts, or sneakers; was judged; see him with one, something's up, the day he has a breakdown
- went on a rant this morning on how the entire school didn't, .... forgot to hit f8, silly me, on the board, "Manfiesto to Take over the World", "Blacklist google Doc"; wait isn't that admissable evidence? never trust technology; cont. no projectors in the building, used to punish kids that they didn't like by making kids go outside of school and clap chalk erasers; maybe bullying specific, plume of white smoke having an asthma attack; it was glorious!, there was no bullying policies; there were no email; the parents would have to call the school and leave a message, guidance used to be main office; "you have a message from your mailbox" find a phone and call the parent back. `my god when did you start?`
- Adam Smith is on the Â£20 note
- They wanted to replcae Andrew Jackson, put Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill, 2016 came around, that was thrown away, rolled into pandameic, still hasn't happened, not pressing issue
- carts definitely had well made German ball bearings to roll nicely up sheer 45 degree
- Child Labor is common...
- we're going all German linguisticly, no hypens, insane compound words, 
- public schools are a waste of money, lets just defund them; don't get me all happy, spend all time in the Homestead; he's still banned for the record (Francis)
- kid today wearing a Lilo and Stitch t-shirt in the hallway, told faculty member, my 7-year old is wearing that shirt! they don't, actually have dignity (something the students don't know). Says I dont'have friends, when Pagan walks by (that's her job to deal with)
- what have you done to contribute to our home (parent's love asking this)
- just say no to kids rant, upside, think about who does all the work, like shoveling snow and ranking leaves; kid almost started to cry, parents don't love us, just had us for free labor
- don't drive on Route 46, used to (didn't know where McDonalds was) probably don't let you drive down that road to nearby town; there's a historic sign at one point, most people going 60mph and don't see it, sure they can lawyer out of it; getting pulled over, was just crying, that is indeed an option; that's the problem with America, if polilce wants to take you in, don't fight, not going to have a courthouse thing on the side of the road; get out of car in Europe after getting pulled over, if you do that in America you're done; crazy
- children are seen and not heard, at lunch it sounds like the Wild West at a distance, kids just roaming the halls
- if you beat child workers now, there would be problems, lawsuits (it's funny because that's illegal)
- adult overseer in factory picture, would just hit the kids with a stick; they would scurry as they got up off the floor; hit them hard, but not too hard, they can't work if they are unconscious; would scream at the and fire adults instead of bothering
- could be physics problem!, a coal cart weighing 500kg, rope breaks in the front, I don't think those kids in the back weigh that much, days over, end of the tunnel is darked, just hope for the best, crushed, maimed; what about the safety guard over at the plastic; ain't no safety guard; as the kids are bleeding over the floor and products with their figners cut off, throw the kids to the streets with a blood trail (lol) just grab another kid off the street.
- job for you, grab wicker basket cleaning the fibers off the floor; I'm too old for that, never too old for a job, it's that or college, or wallmart!
- there was gender equality for child labor, very progressive capitalists!
- kid gets their hand chopped off, you're done, bleeding away; kids die from emphysema at 12 coal mine; nowadays if you go do doctor, at age 12, if you have emphysema, get up go see another doctor; now if you start smoking at a young age, you get emphysema (not normal at 12, black lung)
- if you made it to 1, lucky get crushed by a coal cart at 5; in other places, lucky to not be part of mortaility rate, not to get deep at 12:30 on a Wednesday
- contraceptives don't exist, always have the option of the smothering pillow, at least keep the kids around so they make money until they die in an industrial accident; go to factory 5-6, make back money, if they make it to 7, make profit back; cost benefit analysis; would literally have children every 11 months, the stork would come, the cabbage patch; family living in a tenement in Europe, 12 year old, 11 y/o ... all the way down to a newborn; like 10 kids then parents; Women were constantly pregnant, infant mortality high, miscarriages, mothers sometimes died; rich people had midwives; by 12:30, it's already gotten pretty deep; it's okay if you need to go talk to somebody
- not wearing a tie, don't have a PhD or beanie, criticizing something I didn't make
- at the time, was an island nation, need coal and water; people still have steam engines, not to judge your parents; it's kind of cool
- 19th century cities vs modern, whats the difference? pollution, London fog, etc.; Thames so polluted they had to adjourn Parliament, Westminister stunk so bad; ironically that's where people got their drinking water and cholera from; 2 for 1! parts of the world, people die from that every day, another thing we take for granted in America, go to the kitchen, drink the water, and proclaim, "thank god i'm not going to get cholera!", go talk to someone; for the rest of us that live in freedom, go to well and drink, won't get cholera; have electrical pumps for groundwater; drinking freedom all day, you don't even know it *holds up water bottle*
- college next year, wherever, just walks in and gives a TBV with scantron, here you go! professor would probably let me in, because you look like this? no because late to class; college professors get tenure, after that you can do whatever the hell you want; can show Breakfast Club to class, Terzis can't, since not tenured
- someone bought a telegram set one year, should just build a shelf and leave the telegraphs there; people charged messages by the word, very succinct, sometimes ambiguous messages to save money; nowadays, Morse code; kid got busted for having their phone in test,
- back when I was a kid, someone was president, probably having an affair with somebody, radio was popular, could listen to little Orphan Annie on the radio; if you said a bad word you got a bar of soap in your mouth; Christmas Story, probably on right now on multiple channels, don't bring up good memories of Christmas; wanted red-ridder BB gun, wanted a browning automatic for christmas! it's a love-hate relationship, hate Christmas, movie is good because nostalgiac; lives in NJ, needs a fire-arm license; listen, in NJ that's a whole nother level, want BB (it's considered a fire-arm); alot of paper work; gun ownership, nice job, we're #1 (also in teen pregnancies)
