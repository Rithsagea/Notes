- quizbowl team beat Princeton A team, and B team beat them; waow there's a high school that's better than us?
- need to get your kids ready for 8 months from now.. you can't do what you're doing right now, don't wear sweatshirt to university you are going to; the people in the back wearing school pride shirts mean business; old money or new, this is ML, don't need to describe difference, don't matter what the difference, as long as there's money it's fine; there's probably Rockefeller roots here; town rules, if you are neither, go live somewhere else, Pensyltucky
- being part of a labor union in America is like being a communist, memes of inauguration of Bernie Sanders, he's advanced age (old but PC); wonder where he went
- this is America! don't tell me what to do; `do not erase`, can just erase anyways
- I have loyal people, just like the KGB, knows that people in the back are reading the TBVs that are happening today
- Republic of Texas, lone star state, if you don't see me around I'll be there
- I knew it, there's gangs, (student is wearing a sweatshirt with label `STA`); when you apply for college, depending on the school, have to honestly fill out the application, certain schools (have you ever been suspended for school, Yes or No, if Yes explain) you check that box you're done; if you do something it's on your permanent record forever; colleges promote ethics, and don't want to admit people who are a `nuisance to society`; has that ever been put on your police file, next to your mugshot?
- thankfully in America today the government is not controlled by business interests and wealthy people \\s
- group protests and walkouts, March 13, 2020; I have a pretty good memory for dates; did not know what was going on until Kevin literally sprinted past me on the ramp; put 2 and 2 together, walk out was totally effective \\s, we were on the front page of the daily record, parents were probably happy, property value going up!
- the American Pageant might not be a reputable source; I could say something, but I would not, vis a vis, grades (someone saying they've never read it before)
- angry parents or angry teachers is redundant construction, like oblivious students; it's funny because stereotyping 
- I'm just a simple person, what do I know about math; Macroeconomics should theoretically be easier, also teaching that course, you can do either first, they chose to do theoretically the hardest part first; Macro applies to history first, so I'm biased, not to cause problems
- Romanovs, new Russian people who moved in town, just like the Medicis who moved in \\s; kid months later, why were you lying to us!? that's your problem
- remember our happy story about Poland, and how it no longer exists; wait what happened in the half an hour ago, did they immediately get destroyed?; check twitter feed, `#polandisgoneagain`
- Soviets, it's 1983, just wave your fists and make sure you don't support them; Soviet propaganda somewhere out in the woods; it was on their last legs because of Reagan
- I want this, I want that, Veruka, instead you get nothing; I want a Mercedes! I want a trust fund!, get sent down the egg chute, up the chocolate pipe, burned alive in the trash room; keys taken away, trust fund password changed; I want a kid to wear a reflective wall mart t-shirt at some point
- the whole Cold War unit, just going to pull up my year and tell stories from my childhood
- did a lot of wikipedia reading over the break, clicked on all the hyperlinks, pretty good for my first year teaching history! now I know Russian history
- church of metal, Francis is joining the church of Scientology, walk in to class and just says it; how do I become the sane one around here?
