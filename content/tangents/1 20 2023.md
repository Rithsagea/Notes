- Ferris, Edward Rueny; used to call the old principal like that, could quote it like Shakespeare, Seinfeld, talking about American culture; yea, they love their football in Europe \\s; soccer, America football, Giants...
- last year, all the students complained about Ziccardi staring at them; everyone was sitting so far away
- I shall go push the button, go down to the office and just start blasting heavy metal harmonica, Ozzy's solo
- don't do anything offensive in any of your classes this week!
- my right arthritic shoulder is really flaring up again, let me just stretch it, *points at the Ukraine flag*; it's only the right shoulder, because that's the splitting shoulder, once that axe comes up, it's going down onto a piece of red oak
- do not get confused, writing Botulism instead of Anarchism on the May 5th AP test, CollegeBoard going to send an email to the school, `what's wrong with these kids?`
- kids randomly know me, come up to me in the hallway like I'm their best friend; `oh I just know you`, don't know who they are, sometimes know their neighbours, cousins, or friends
- random classes having "fun Fridays!"
- only here because didn't stop to look at danger, tangent about one of the world leaders assassinated by anarchists surviving one bomb, opening door to see what happened, only for them to throw another one into his car
- can't tell if I get along with Francis, or detest him; Hoffman get's along with everyone; we don't meet with each other, we like it up here, it's our turf; Sikha's a good man
- kids thought that Caesar invented salad dressing (this is not how it works)
- told the kids that the Cold War happened in the winter one year; oh yeah, that's why it's called the Cold War, it was cold! \\s (stultus)
- sorry if you heard "downward spiral" from your guidance counselor, for your 5th year here; guidance probably has yelled at you kids "have you not learned!", gambles always pay off, just like businesses are always profitable
- most people think of Russia in Europe and Asia, don't know it's in between; had a discussion yesterday at dinner with the kids; you kids probably talk about Super Mario and Pokemon
- used to have all school assemblies, commonly; in the Spring of every year, had all-school assemblies; this reminds me of Stalin in the '30s, whoever stopped clapping first would have some problems; colleague at the time got the reference, now these people probably won't
- thank god the Germans won Stalingrad... deadliest war in history (some reference about Russia constantly being humiliated in war)
- I know you're not used to being humiliated or losing, I'm not used to that either, in the same boat with you kids
- `discontent`, if you don't know what that means, would describe the faculty in the building with that
- some student brought up a flute, and asked if it was better or worse than Ozzy's harmonica solo in `The Wizard`; probably not the best time given MP about to end
- baby was allegedly killed in the Hoovervilles Bonus Army
- option 2 is never the right choice because it is detestable (gym for free period); parents probably try to placate kids, should just walk away and let them have the tantrum; if you do that you've won; it's like 4 college options, none of them are good decisions, option 5, Wallmart
- don't talk bad about Doug, used to be neighbors... carpool; he never coached track, I coached track with 2 people who retired, and Mr. Reed, a good man; Jeffrey, not the other Mr. Reed, who was a legend; Mr. Wilkins came out of retirement like him one year to do coaching, man was principal in the building for decades, was football coach back in the day, is no longer with us anymore (the field is named after him)
- like how you lie to your parents when you're groveling, in between the sobs and tears `I swear, I'll change things`, one of the student's smiling, this guy knows how it works, whether it's a 5 y/o or an 18 y/o
