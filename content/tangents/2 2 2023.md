- when I coached here, back in the day, when we didn't have a turf, I made them run back and forth and get their shoes lost, `be a man!` can't say that anymore, kids used to sass me and go "run across the infield" they would run full speed, shoes get stuck in the mud, just keep running; if they were really sassy, make them run the hill; I haven't been up there for so long, didn't know they put lights up the trail, for 10 years; back in the day invited us to homecoming thing; actually had tailgating for teachers; principal at the time... don't even need to tell you; walking
- should get your cough looked at... might be malaria, or botulism
- it's period 6, i'm sure you students have all had reviews in your classes before; `they just show up and we don't even know what's going on!`
- don't let the kids have cookies, take it and crumble it in their hand; shouldn't give kids tide pod cookies, going to give them poisoning! I wouldn't know quality of whole foods oreos; do I seem like a whole foods person? who do you think you're talking to. nooo, I swear, on a student's grade, I've never been to a WholeFoods since we ain't got em; you're living back on the west coast where you're from; we don't have whole foods, here are your options; super Walmart, super Walmart, tractor supply (no people food) and farmer's market; I know people who can hook me up with stuff for free, as much corn as I need
- don't light cigarettes next to flammable tanks of gas; think twice before you light up!
- all your rage and animalistic tendencies, that's the id; if you didn't have the other 2 components society would be anarchy, people would do whatever they wanted; like **they should stop having children**, when in doubt... smothering pillow, "accidental" suffocation; within the year they probably won't be around, succumb to tuberculosis; infant mortality is still used to gauge development in countries; America, (developed country) is relatively low; per 1000 live births, how many children survive their first year; Alabama is Alabama... Mississippi has the same development metric as Slovenia (I'm sure where all of you know where that is on a map); remember that video with Francisco; or else look at test scores... it's been done, beating a dead horse
- I don't teach psychology in this building nor could I... I'm a simpleton; was it wrong last period as seniors were failing tests, was I wrong holding up the computer with tabs showing the sites to random college admission sites; quieted them down, they got quite worried
- hobbo is offensive, can't say that anymore; say "displaced person" or "vagabond"; `gypsy` is also off limits; you kids love your Halloween given that you're 18 ~~it's completely ok~~; also that article that I wrote regarding this topic is still on canvas,... 2011; we still have a newspaper segment about this; hobbo reminds me of someone who dresses up as Halloween, rides the rails in those little satchels; can't say that
- thank god the steering wheel doesn't fall off the car (Tesla), somebody in NJ was driving on the highway, and the steering wheel fell off the Tesla; buy a Japanese like a Subaru... steering wheel ain't gonna fall off
- we need Francis here... no we don't, trust me
- poll the kids, who is Nietzsche? I think he's one of the math teachers...; convinced kids that Freud is a guidance counselor, kid literally walked down into the office and asked to talk to `Dr. Freud`; kid described Freud as a very famous Vietnamese doctor (???)
- oh boy, you're in for some very readable readings... Philosophy class; no offense, you kids would struggle with Nietzsche's writing (it's a lot of rambling) if you try to understand a page of Nietzsche, you're just gonna go like, I've gotta give up, nothing makes sense; punitively, if you sassed him, Monday reading 30 pages of Nietzsche, it's an academic death sentence!
- how many of your parents are psychiatrists, how many of parents work for the circus, how many of your parents work? how many of your parents work at Whole Foods? ... do I go to whole foods? what is cottage core... I've never heard that word in my life
- `God is dead` that's a black sabbath album... oh dear I'm going to get a few emails today
- news story, was a bit teary-eyed; Ozzy is not touring anymore because of his failing health; have I seen him on tour? yes! that's like asking if you've ever wore a school pride shirt
- I swear I will read wikipedia cover to cover, and find out what happened 1939
- you'll take psychology... maybe in a couple of months; freshman year people usually take intro to pscyh, `that's a bunch of garbage`, do not say that to your professor in 7 months
- might have told some of them... they seemed very stressed last period , the seniors taking the art test; as they were sitting there and had their pencil cases ready, and said `you should bring your pencil case to college in a couple months cuz you'll gain a bunch of street cred with your professor`; try it and find out and get back to me; send me an email!
- don't google too far with Freud...
- surrealism, which ironically was an art movement which they just failed last period... influenced by Sigmund Freud
- did you let your pal know their pajamas were illegal? the homeless kid sitting in the hallway.. I don't know she was, she won't take your class because she thinks you are scary; fear is a healthy emotion! like one of your Latin Teachers, Machiavelli!
- I used to walk around a lot going, **repress the id!**, kids need to calm down, stop acting like a bunch of little animals!
- go home today, go `I realized I have a subconcious!`, ok... here's some kinetic sand, play, here's a cookie
- sweet sweet Chris, came in today, he walked by the room and the kids all shuddered, he then I guess walked the other way, I pulled the Ozzy poster out and asked him to come back; the conversation back and forth got so awkward, the kids were just mentally like... what happened... overwhelmed. for the record, I won (?)
- this is getting really deep, how do you know all of this stuff, didn't I say that psychology is garbage
- lets dabble in sociology, another worthless field; going to get emails from parents; dear sir, I have a master's in sociology; it's like one ridiculous step down the pole from psychology, in legitimacy, like Latin; yea I'm getting a degree in Philosophy, yea we areen't going to sign the check
- remember that day, came around the hallway, was like a deer in the headlights; Ziccardi and Francis talking; I feel like they have an uneasy armistice ... like 1900; who's Hitler and who's Stalin? I wanna be Stalin!... the gulag is Latin class, I asked Sikha if he has a shovel, he does!; I'll bring them to slap them on the desk
- expectations... like student expectations, societal expectations... we don't have a school rule that's explicitly, you can't walk down the hallway and elbow kids as you run... actually that's a good idea, not in honor code or anywhere, it's not illegal; HIB is optional...
- repression of desires is healthy; told Betsy, listen, I know this stuff, I'll do this next year, giving out squirrels, and giving crushed raisins out; kids aren't in the office, just cranking out ACDC Highway to Hell; I'll say this, Back in Black was not overrated, problem is it's not Von Sott; better singer vs Brian... not role model all the way, didn't last very long; couldn't make up how he died in his sleep like Julius Caesar; good guy, he should go on the wall
- I don't show many middle school images of our yearbook, but this is a picture of a club, I"m the one with the top hat *image of Fullmetal Jacket*; show it to the kids today... ~~it's very appropriate~~; seriously none of you have seen this? I guess all of these references are for naught; Sikha is also a Seinfeld guy; in the summer, the tape melted and fell into the garbage, and they through it out
- should all go home and tell your parents that they are gonna watch Clockwork Orange in class; it's so inappropriate, I guess only 4 minutes out of 2:30 hours; play a trick on Terzis, tell him we watched this in class; still won't show the Breakfast Club; does he come in every day repressing his desire to watch this movie? we talked about sonnets today... what did you do to deserve that today? # weak! what's next... iambic pentameter if we work hard? omigosh, Shakespeare! don't say that, don't go `#nerd`, reading's for nerds, which I think I have said many times
- can your parents all come in one day... cuz no offense; that was back to school night! teachers would hate that... got so many dirty looks; allegedly wore a tie; pointed at one of them, is she helping you? I don't know nothing, exactly! *walked away*; that's this whole place, just sitting here and doing nothing
- protagonist is infatuated with Ludwig von Beethoven (Clockwork Orange); `Beethoven is better than heavy metal!` Say that to your dad, will get all smacked up, and you were outside for that weak, holding the disconnected Tesla steering wheel, as consolation, like a teddy bear
- were you aware that you were repressing that for 18 years... existential crisis at 1am; talked about this a lot; alphabetical seating chart; hated the people at the start of class, cuz they were all As and Bs at start of last name (Ziccardi starts with Z)
- have I ever started with `when I was a kid during the cold war!`, godless Soviets is redundant; kid went oh wow they actually are atheists; that's what counts... not what you think but the government *animated graphic of duck and cover in a nuke*; remember the monkey with the firecracker on the pole, that's what we did, jump off the couch, under the desk, if you were in the hallway, good luck; kind of sexist, all the girls had to wear skirts; kid on the couch, wearing business apparel, reading a book, that's how you know it was years ago
- hey kid did you ever get a sunburn? that's what a nuclear blast feels like; that sound like government propaganda to me; Burt the Turtle, real commissioned by the US government; how about the part where the kid chucks the bike and dives under the curb, and wait until the cop taps him on the shoulder and tells him he's ok; cartoon says he ok 
- if you need a website to let you know how to deal with your kids... you're weak; `hey siri, what do I do if my kid is beating me with a stick`
- I wasted 50 mintues of your time going over this rubbish!; tell them in dinner in passing that we have watched Clockwork orange, all sorts of fun stuff
