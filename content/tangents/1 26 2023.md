- ~~in our town, it's not about sports, or academics, it's all about opera~~ I'm sure you guys bought the vinyl copies of Wagner's albums, even though there's no way to put that much content on an album
- you guys are so polite, vs the seniors last period, who had to sit down because I was so angry; it would be kind of hilarious, being that they haven't taken any sit-down grades yet, who might be failing the 3rd marking period because of failing the expectations; I think one of them (not a man of law) is that you're not supposed to talk over your teacher; 5 minutes left.. had to gently set the computer down, and not chuck it across the room; "abhorrent behavior" -Ziccardi from that class; it's not a graduation requirement, but failing the class could cause college to rescind admissions
- asking parents I want a Mercedes, I've never worked a day in my life! instead you get `Ok Veruca, hush!` I want it now! please stop yelling.. I have no control... you want a house in Aruba? it's actually in Florida... how did you know?
- "the incinerator" stop talking about Toy Story 3!!! the darkest times, Sunny Side Daycare; maybe they'll all get incinerated, and it'll be the end of the series... thank god it's over now (Toy Story 4)
- gonna go beyond the slide for once, it's February, probably time enough for that; crazy expectations, kids will listen to teachers and won't talk over all of us; some of the feeble old teachers haven't showed up because they don't have their voices back; a lot of teachers are absent today... "not feeling it"; ... Fusco's my boss! he's your coach... 
- if the kids were about to overthrow the administrators... tell them to go to gym and state their grievances; put 2x4s on the door and revolt dies down
- kids come in over the years, wearing shirts like "Stanford" where did you get that? i don't know. you're wearing the shirt.. how do you not know where it's from? at garage sales just show up and buy a t-shirt; concerned if you open up your closet, random clothes... put it on
- you're going to college next year; made it through college freshman year, turns out none of those courses counted; jokes on you
- 2x4, did you use it? let the kid have the tantrum, just have your fit on the linoleum floor sliding around
- understand that, in this building, levels of emergency, like a walk-out, and it doesn't go anywhere even with your t-shirts because we don't meet for another 3 months; wasn't here yesterday, stuff has happened in this building that I find out about months later (not allowed out of my cage here); one of the younger gym teachers asked why I was in the lobby; should I go back to my cage, or take a lap; I can go wherever I want; don't believe in MLEA, if you do you're communist! American blue, voted for Eisenhower twice! all of your parents, would advise them to follow rules, vis a vis filing federal income taxes due April 15th, I do my own taxes (really?) one of the important numbers is "that number" which you don't get to claim (my advice don't even bring that up)
- what would I know about German history, I barely got through 8th grade
- please tell me your parents don't pull a Friedrich Wilhelm IV; tell the kids to go detail out their plan and demands, then flat out refuse
- BBC is legit, ran a video on Habsburg Jaw
- Doc showed us a Buzzfeed article today; talk about a teacher working at Costco because benefits are better; you guys don't want to hear it, need to be more professional; over the years would threaten the kids with Walmart; threatened some guy who tried to bribe me with Stranger Things monopoly money
- if you use big words on the AP exam, will say our school is coming back, other wise "we've heard things"
- over the weekend, toured Austrian Hungarian empire, and toured it with some Franz Ferdinand guy; oh god they took a WWI test, had to explain to kids what the Cabinet was, who are voting in a year, or the we have 3 branches of government in this country; `Fran's Fredinand`; ironically just put in a supply request for more red pens today
- finally realized that inbreeding is bad from Habsburgs;
- Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia, I wonder something like that happened back when I was 30
- if you act like the kids last period, I would say a word in German, map quiz of Austrian ethnic map (it's literally just a bunch of colors paint splattered on the map)
- foreshadowing... they are going to be failing the 3rd marking period without having even taking a test; I'm going to be in a teaching journal somewhere; don't say `quote the number, that goes to all the great magazines you read cover to cover, like the NJEA today`, there's a way to check the box instead of coming to my Homestead and going to my fire, and it goes into the mailbox, then going into the trash can, sorry recycling bin; I don't advocate anything... especially college; boy scouts of America... maybe
- "are you going to the showcase?" do I seem like that kind of guy; convinced some kids that I was going to be the new golf coach; do I seem like a golf coach? no; there was no girls team for golf.. boy that sounds like an impending lawsuit; I'm going to follow a little ball around into a hole
- Pappa Kardashian, dead, he was a legit guy, except the kids; Cesaro hates them; seriously OJ, he was the on the dream team lawyer; 6th + 7th amendment, civil and due process;
- one kid on a year, self determination :: `if you try really hard you can get stuff done`, what is wrong with you this isn't psychology, this is political stuff
- shock to kids in who didn't even know that Presidential election stuff; referred to Hitler as the failed artist, they didn't even know that he wasn't German; renounced Austrian citizenship, not to give you guys ideas; Canada is a nice place, socialist, Wayne Gretsky, ice hockey, their national sport is lacrosse, who are my lacrosse people in this town; it's literally the national past-time, which was invented in Canada; people's perceptions changed... they are good people; it was an indigenous sport, then the Canadians stole it
- Full Metal Jacket, we are watching this after the AP test, Animal Mother ~~this is a more kid friendly movie~~ first half of the movie is like its own movie (boot camp as marine) second half was `in-country`, did you ever learn about the Vietnam War, critical as to why were watching **primary source documentaries** (US2); there was a point in this building where as far as you would get in US history was WWII, it's June, have a nice time on the final! now, can get much further; if you're lucky; Vietnam used to be the end of that course
- do you know what a sink is? ask your butler; describes a whirlpool; symbolically there are many things that can be put going down the drain, not a generation, or a high school... this is not good! you're lucky you have a sink! some kids just go down to the river with a washboard; first world problems... my butler sassed me! wait you guys have bathrooms? `I dropped my BMW keys in the sink then it broke`
- when in doubt... better than Poland
- inbreeding, is that England now, Habsburgs, then, or whatever
- we're doing this... we're doing that! listen student... there is now "we", there's a yall, us teachers, NJEA teachers, NJEA today...
- in 1916, Europe was undergoing world war 3! \\s
