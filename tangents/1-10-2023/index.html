left a stack of papers to grade along the week; triage grading, could be like in a teaching journal</li><li>went on a rant to Fusco about the block schedule this week; might see some courses this week 4 times; as counsel, as free legal advice, if you owe any work in any of your classes; colleges like nice, well rounded classes in senior year, nice 2 easy classes so you&mldr;\s; in other classes more egregious, would be a real shame if they got a 0 and didn&rsquo;t make up any work; conversation with one of the government teachers, but a bit different; they were a little nicer and less vindictive</li><li>Latin disappears this week; it&rsquo;s dead</li><li>depiction of Ziccardi&rsquo;s homestead in expo marker on the board; I would not trust the children with pitchforks; hatchet > axe > pitchfork; if you screw up you get demoted then to hatchet; depending on how egregious the industrial incident was, how many fingers are severed&mldr;; my kids have skills academically, they don&rsquo;t come here because it would show up most of the kids; in Art class yestereday, vertically challenged kids, don&rsquo;t bring my kids here because they&rsquo;re just bigger</li><li>don&rsquo;t quote me on that, that&rsquo;s academic gambling</li><li>if I can&rsquo;t see the microbe, it don&rsquo;t exist; if I can&rsquo;t see it, it don&rsquo;t exist; don&rsquo;t say that to Chris, he might flip out a little</li><li>it&rsquo;s always a great day in this course when we talk about infanticide (smothering pillow)</li><li>you kids take for granted you go down to the kitchen and ask your butler for a drink out of a sink, take for granted that you won&rsquo;t get cholera; back then canned food would be putrid (if you don&rsquo;t know that google, don&rsquo;t hit images), sometimes canned improperly it would cause bacteria to be trapped; they ate food that was spoiled, botulism (severe food poisoning); if the can is bulging, don&rsquo;t eat it, it probably has botulism; dw it&rsquo;s good, sprinkle some on your corn flakes and you will get food poisoning, botulism; back in the day, in Health class, would have an entire marking period on botulism, MP2 anabolic steroids (Russians go brr); vs us in America <del>we were all natural</del>; ask at dinner tonight about steroids; Rocky 4, blatant, they&rsquo;re juicing the Russian, only 2 kids watched it, is that who it was in a black limo watching Rocky running around in Siberia flipping logs; Russians randomly injected sus serum into guys arm; thank god people in America didn&rsquo;t use steroids, Rick Flare and &mldr; eat veggies <em>then take steroids</em>; now we just talk about cigarettes, would then bring in a diseased lung; have you ever seen a lung up close that has emphysima; then MP4 was on scurvy or something&mldr; (was actually in one of the health books) the teacher made fun of how old it was in the book</li><li>day of reckoning, in 8 months; college, double-edged sword; parents don&rsquo;t check up every day, on your own , responsibility ,some people cannot handle it, some people come back handing out candy on Halloween</li><li>do not round randomly next period in math test; the math teachers in this building will not find it cute</li><li>do not write numbers, write roman numerals; told the sophomores <strong>the collegeboard will judge!</strong>, said a lot last year&mldr; back in the day; the sophomores needed to do a worksheet to learn</li><li>House MD. he&rsquo;s a difficult guy who&rsquo;s kind of smart; Hugh Larie allegedly dated 16; kid got a plague, diving under the reef, got cut from a bottle; drove his car into Cuddy&rsquo;s house, is that frowned upon?</li><li>when things get difficult run away, academically ruin away; just like Neville Chamberlain, looked away, he was a spineless worm (some people last remember would only remember this); worms by definition are spineless</li><li>you all know that feeling, resentment; especially if you have siblings; <code>restored</code> is in red to undermine your collective ability to process things; also to define Congress; going over next period with US 1 kids, it&rsquo;s part of the curriculum, on the board so we don&rsquo;t have to write it again</li><li>it&rsquo;s a shame when genesis makes mistakes because you can&rsquo;t trust computer programs; crytically warned classes to not offend teachers, will remember end of marking period; like kids need to be worried last week, screamed at kids last week; problem when you are having a meltdown, if you have to censor yourself, it&rsquo;s frowned upon for teachers and administrators to curse at children; they have been rude since I inherited them, like a orphans on the doorstep; there&rsquo;s 5 of us in this situation, makes me feel a little better, they also have miserable kids in those classes; we have a PD workshop on that tomorrow</li><li>if you put the image of the bunker on the board, might trigger some people (Francis); the board is messed up because they didn&rsquo;t clean it up quick enough (sophomores curious) they allegedly cleaned the boards every night; now it&rsquo;s unusuable, can&rsquo;t get rid of the smudges</li><li>just like us simple teachers, we are being told what to do by the very powerful group of guidance, who told us about when grades are due, and when recommendations were due next year; <code>don't go to college</code>, Ray, the kids need help next year; I like your tie, Ray, but they need help; need to respect people who wear ties, legitimate people; allegedly wore tie on back-to-school night; students are supposed to help parents around; some parents thought that there was a lunch break, randomly missed a period; parents are so old they need nappy time and snack; they need to close their eyes, and obviously not fall asleep because they are so old; I wasn&rsquo;t asleep, trust me because I said so</li><li>leave that to the smart people in this place, i&rsquo;m not one of them, who likes to read, that&rsquo;s for nerds; how spot on was I as a wizard, about Montville and who lives there, reading is for nerds, should be on a bumper sticker</li><li>can&rsquo;t please everyone, sound familiar kids?, can&rsquo;t please guidance, administrators, sweet sweet Chris</li><li>there&rsquo;s a kids book titled President Taft Got Stuck in the Bath, made mistake of bringing it home, it became on of their favorite books, the way it&rsquo;s written is horrible; even though it was a bad, they learned to read quickly; lemme tell you something about the pin factory kids, division of labor</li><li>I believe this, I will keep it to myself in my Google Doc, share it to Twitter and social media, videos of your own beliefs</li><li>how many of you were late to school this morning? they now print out a piece of paper, there&rsquo;s this whole printout, unlike this pass for the last 20 years, hand written on your way done; had to end with <code>do you think kids in Japan are late to school</code> (there are no kids in Japan)</li><li><code>rescinded</code>, it&rsquo;s the cure-all for senioritis in this building, tell Ray to just straighten out his tie, try to make himself look presentable; ono, 1st world problems, can&rsquo;t work, can&rsquo;t focus on this 6 hours of school; it&rsquo;s 8 o&rsquo;clock, don&rsquo;t want to show up to school; going to park tomorrow with headlights on Subaru sound systems on blasting metal while eating breakfast</li><li>people love censorship, right? just like the Mountaineer and its censorship</li><li>Prince Charles book, no one cares about Camilla; my mom was raging about that this morning; that&rsquo;s why we are on the same page</li><li>ladies and gentleman, hatchet, seemingly violent implement, in left hand, is a symbol of peace, Daoism; at the time, it wasn&rsquo;t illegal, no Prohibition, she was just a killjoy, her and her little gang, just old women, needed to be over 60 and have a hatchet, Carrie Nation, show up and harrass men drinking</li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://notes.tempera.dev/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Jacky Zhao using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://notes.tempera.dev/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/Rithsagea>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
