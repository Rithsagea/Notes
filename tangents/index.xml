you kids are not the most egregious; left a stack of papers to grade along the week; triage grading, could be like in a teaching journal went on a rant to Fusco about the block schedule this week; might see some courses this week 4 times; as counsel, as free legal advice, if you owe any work in any of your classes; colleges like nice, well rounded classes in senior year, nice 2 easy classes so you&amp;hellip;\s; in other classes more egregious, would be a real shame if they got a 0 and didn&amp;rsquo;t make up any work; conversation with one of the government teachers, but a bit different; they were a little nicer and less vindictive Latin disappears this week; it&amp;rsquo;s dead depiction of Ziccardi&amp;rsquo;s homestead in expo marker on the board; I would not trust the children with pitchforks; hatchet &amp;gt; axe &amp;gt; pitchfork; if you screw up you get demoted then to hatchet; depending on how egregious the industrial incident was, how many fingers are severed&amp;hellip;; my kids have skills academically, they don&amp;rsquo;t come here because it would show up most of the kids; in Art class yestereday, vertically challenged kids, don&amp;rsquo;t bring my kids here because they&amp;rsquo;re just bigger don&amp;rsquo;t quote me on that, that&amp;rsquo;s academic gambling if I can&amp;rsquo;t see the microbe, it don&amp;rsquo;t exist; if I can&amp;rsquo;t see it, it don&amp;rsquo;t exist; don&amp;rsquo;t say that to Chris, he might flip out a little it&amp;rsquo;s always a great day in this course when we talk about infanticide (smothering pillow) you kids take for granted you go down to the kitchen and ask your butler for a drink out of a sink, take for granted that you won&amp;rsquo;t get cholera; back then canned food would be putrid (if you don&amp;rsquo;t know that google, don&amp;rsquo;t hit images), sometimes canned improperly it would cause bacteria to be trapped; they ate food that was spoiled, botulism (severe food poisoning); if the can is bulging, don&amp;rsquo;t eat it, it probably has botulism; dw it&amp;rsquo;s good, sprinkle some on your corn flakes and you will get food poisoning, botulism; back in the day, in Health class, would have an entire marking period on botulism, MP2 anabolic steroids (Russians go brr); vs us in America we were all natural; ask at dinner tonight about steroids; Rocky 4, blatant, they&amp;rsquo;re juicing the Russian, only 2 kids watched it, is that who it was in a black limo watching Rocky running around in Siberia flipping logs; Russians randomly injected sus serum into guys arm; thank god people in America didn&amp;rsquo;t use steroids, Rick Flare and &amp;hellip; eat veggies then take steroids; now we just talk about cigarettes, would then bring in a diseased lung; have you ever seen a lung up close that has emphysima; then MP4 was on scurvy or something&amp;hellip; (was actually in one of the health books) the teacher made fun of how old it was in the book day of reckoning, in 8 months; college, double-edged sword; parents don&amp;rsquo;t check up every day, on your own , responsibility ,some people cannot handle it, some people come back handing out candy on Halloween do not round randomly next period in math test; the math teachers in this building will not find it cute do not write numbers, write roman numerals; told the sophomores the collegeboard will judge!</description></item><item><title>1 2 2023</title><link>https://notes.tempera.dev/tangents/1-2-2023/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.tempera.dev/tangents/1-2-2023/</guid><description>don&amp;rsquo;t put ketchup on squirrels, paprika and teriyaki is fine; roasting squirrels is pretty fast, there isn&amp;rsquo;t much meat there kids got a skating rink in property, all the rain froze over, only melted 2 days ago; 2 inches of ice, 4 meters across Western Union still exists, for money; first job interned on a stage coach, literally road shotgun; back in the day, American idiomatic expressions, stagecoaches were very common as form of travel (like Cinderella) rider with reigns on left, person sitting on right (passenger seat on car) btw there were no cars, called riding shotgun because it was so dangerous, bandits rob people inside, ride holding a shotgun for protection (preferrably 12 gauge); people were paid in cash, try to rob it on paydays; hate people in historical places, they don&amp;rsquo;t break character (what&amp;rsquo;s the time?</description></item><item><title>1 4 2023</title><link>https://notes.tempera.dev/tangents/1-4-2023/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.tempera.dev/tangents/1-4-2023/</guid><description>rubber door stops were removed, since states decided they were illegal;
