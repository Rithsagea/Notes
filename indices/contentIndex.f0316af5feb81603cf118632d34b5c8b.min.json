The other reactions can be used in combination with the previous reaction's rate law to find the overall rate law of the reaction.\n### Arrhenius Equation\nGenerally, activation energy is positive, and creates slower reactions at higher values.

(was actually in one of the health books) the teacher made fun of how old it was in the book\n- day of reckoning, in 8 months; college, double-edged sword; parents don't check up every day, on your own , responsibility ,some people cannot handle it, some people come back handing out candy on Halloween\n- do not round randomly next period in math test; the math teachers in this building will not find it cute\n- do not write numbers, write roman numerals; told the sophomores **the collegeboard will judge!**, said a lot last year... back in the day; the sophomores needed to do a worksheet to learn\n- House MD. he's a difficult guy who's kind of smart; Hugh Larie allegedly dated 16; kid got a plague, diving under the reef, got cut from a bottle; drove his car into Cuddy's house, is that frowned upon?\n- when things get difficult run away, academically ruin away; just like Neville Chamberlain, looked away, he was a spineless worm (some people last remember would only remember this); worms by definition are spineless\n- you all know that feeling, resentment; especially if you have siblings; `restored` is in red to undermine your collective ability to process things; also to define Congress; going over next period with US 1 kids, it's part of the curriculum, on the board so we don't have to write it again\n- it's a shame when genesis makes mistakes because you can't trust computer programs; crytically warned classes to not offend teachers, will remember end of marking period; like kids need to be worried last week, screamed at kids last week; problem when you are having a meltdown, if you have to censor yourself, it's frowned upon for teachers and administrators to curse at children; they have been rude since I inherited them, like a orphans on the doorstep; there's 5 of us in this situation, makes me feel a little better, they also have miserable kids in those classes; we have a PD workshop on that tomorrow\n- if you put the image of the bunker on the board, might trigger some people (Francis); the board is messed up because they didn't clean it up quick enough (sophomores curious) they allegedly cleaned the boards every night; now it's unusuable, can't get rid of the smudges\n- just like us simple teachers, we are being told what to do by the very powerful group of guidance, who told us about when grades are due, and when recommendations were due next year; `don't go to college`, Ray, the kids need help next year; I like your tie, Ray, but they need help; need to respect people who wear ties, legitimate people; allegedly wore tie on back-to-school night; students are supposed to help parents around; some parents thought that there was a lunch break, randomly missed a period; parents are so old they need nappy time and snack; they need to close their eyes, and obviously not fall asleep because they are so old; I wasn't asleep, trust me because I said so\n- leave that to the smart people in this place, i'm not one of them, who likes to read, that's for nerds; how spot on was I as a wizard, about Montville and who lives there, reading is for nerds, should be on a bumper sticker\n- can't please everyone, sound familiar kids?, can't please guidance, administrators, sweet sweet Chris\n- there's a kids book titled President Taft Got Stuck in the Bath, made mistake of bringing it home, it became on of their favorite books, the way it's written is horrible; even though it was a bad, they learned to read quickly; lemme tell you something about the pin factory kids, division of labor\n- I believe this, I will keep it to myself in my Google Doc, share it to Twitter and social media, videos of your own beliefs\n- how many of you were late to school this morning? they now print out a piece of paper, there's this whole printout, unlike this pass for the last 20 years, hand written on your way done; had to end with `do you think kids in Japan are late to school` (there are no kids in Japan)\n- `rescinded`, it's the cure-all for senioritis in this building, tell Ray to just straighten out his tie, try to make himself look presentable; ono, 1st world problems, can't work, can't focus on this 6 hours of school; it's 8 o'clock, don't want to show up to school; going to park tomorrow with headlights on Subaru sound systems on blasting metal while eating breakfast\n- people love censorship, right? just like the Mountaineer and its censorship\n- Prince Charles book, no one cares about Camilla; my mom was raging about that this morning; that's why we are on the same page\n- ladies and gentleman, hatchet, seemingly violent implement, in left hand, is a symbol of peace, Daoism; at the time, it wasn't illegal, no Prohibition, she was just a killjoy, her and her little gang, just old women, needed to be over 60 and have a hatchet, Carrie Nation, show up and harrass men drinking","lastmodified":"2023-03-03T12:23:43.404254974Z","tags":null},"/tangents/1-13-2023":{"title":"1 13 2023","content":"- a 2nd grader, or half the people in this building don't know that the statue of liberty is not a real person\n- if you look closely, there's a riot going on and cars being burnt down\n- really it is? the kids are lazy, good point colleague. *sarcasm light*\n- if you ever need a weapon, use cobblestones\n- if you manage to find yourself in the wrong AP test, maybe you shouldn't be taking AP tests; not that I haven't witnessed it... in university; realize half an hour into the course that you are in the wrong course, do you stand up and leave to get made fun of, or just sit through it; college professors call you by your last names, disrespect (compared to administrators); in the building or in the army they just call you by your last name\n- we're at the end of the marking period, gave advice to idiot kids who did stupid things during this week; don't upset the teachers, they have very short memories \\\\s\n- the kids don't believe in capitalization; we are doomed in this class due to the absence of formal writing skills; all the kids are used to typing in lowercase; the sophomores don't actually learn English in the class\n- never signed the waiver, showed naked woman (painting) in class, going to get emails this week\n- pesky, causing problems, like the freshman in this building, causing fistfights; last period, we do not condone violence \\\\s; in math class, there was a fist fight, it's the math teacher's fault for repressing the kids; could probably get the kids off legally, `it's my client, the kids, not their fault for being repressed`, there have been fistfights over the year, they are rare, usually knee deep in breaking up; last time it was around the same vicinity in the math wing; walking down the hallway, kids stop and form a circle, there was a bit of \"fistocuffs\", sweet Chris and I were there, took a kid by the neck pushed them into locker and told them to calm down; it's not cool, 2 o'clock on a Friday, now I know why you hate the administrators so much; one of the kids was on quizbowl team and got suspended, Krause broke it up; don't keep up with school gang fights in Morris County; video of kid breaking a vending machine somewhere else; there were no phones back then, issue with America, instead of breaking it up, grown adults take out their phones and start recording fights; did not get hit with collateral damage back then, quick on their feet, it wasn't much of a fight, kids nowadays don't know how to fight, when I was a kid...\n- if you wanna find trouble go to a major University campus, like in Southern California, Berkely, burn stuff for fun (administration wanted them to wear shoes or something), literally burned down part of the campus; violence felt good, but next week straight up were missing some buildings in the college; if you get angry and wanna protest something, go to Parhills, we'll still have some of our campus on Monday; at one point they staged a thing where no one wore clothes for one day, because they were against the dress code; will think differently after getting tetanus from getting stabbed by a nail; `who here has gotten tetanus?` it's a myth, just like bigfoot\n- sibling of a student last year, sibling joined a sorority, went to tell papa, was Peter aware of this? oh I don't know about that; would highly dissuade from joining a sorority or fraternity; some of you are smiling, see you know what I'm talking about;\n- there's a test today, test cholera, I know it well, we used to have outbreaks of it, it's been a while; it's whenever there's a test scheduled, the same kid is out every time; another sub variant is `Block 1 is the test and feels so much better Block 2`; teacher gave a test Period 4 back in the day, this block period trash didn't exist, signs out for Period 3 (doctors appointments) and come back Period 5; who are these doctors you can get to and from, get back by 45 minutes? praise the lord you are back from your doctor's appointment, `test cholera`\n- at least the German fraternities have goals, unlike the fraterneties of today\n- was it a test, or a senior moment? incorrect date on the TBV (canvas)\n- tried to cheer up Francisco today, didn't work, made fun of his hat this morning, if it makes you feel better; gee golly, college, wish I went, then walked away\n- don't want to brag, might have been part of secret police, but can't tell you since it's a secret\n- Berkely, walk to class barefoot, since it's sunny Southern California; if you do that in Michigan, you'll get frostbite\n- sorry I stole your classmates candy stash yesterday, then threw back the parts I didn't like; student got it from Ms. Adams room\n- Elvis' daughter died today, just learned, like that gang fight; please let me know if Britain is still a constitutional monarchy, not sure since I'm not like other teachers, checking their twitter feeds in class\n- you know those kids, who have a trust fund and Mercedes since their parents work hard, even though they've never worked a day in their life\n- I should go down to guidance; I forgot to go over a whole week of stuff Betsy; get a lollipop and close the door\n- Francisco, film Friday, I'm worried, he's given up, this isn't good\n- don't need emails about sexism, and women not being able to vote **historically**, no emails (or gang fights) please, it's Friday; you hear me yelling, I had hall duty today, ironically was near Chris' room, which is in the vicinity of the fight; which isn't funny because now it's real; where have we slipped?\n- World kids don't know what entrepreneur is, even though they are in those courses; might have gone into a whole Marxist rant on the kid\n- the candy stash, leprechaun's cauldron with a mouse trap to catch kids in; chilling in art while listening to Bob Dylan?; she's not happy when kids walk out, but you do it anyways, don't respect us\n- NJEA don't bring that up at home, oh god those people, that's why our taxes are so high\n- Pinkertons, not to brag, but on my Common App, got an internship with them one summer, strike breaker, had a whole nametag and outfit, broke up the Haymarket riot\n- going to have to do my taxes soon, which I urge you all to do, tax evasion is a crime; union dues are not a donation, can't write that down; bring that up to Francisco, the whole 54 minutes will be blown, don't say that I told you; he will talk about it for 54 minutes easy, can just put your pens away and pack up, sit back and relax","lastmodified":"2023-03-03T12:23:43.404254974Z","tags":null},"/tangents/1-17-2023":{"title":"1 17 2023","content":"- quizbowl team beat Princeton A team, and B team beat them;

the people in the back wearing school pride shirts mean business; old money or new, this is ML, don't need to describe difference, don't matter what the difference, as long as there's money it's fine; there's probably Rockefeller roots here; town rules, if you are neither, go live somewhere else, Pensyltucky\n- being part of a labor union in America is like being a communist, memes of inauguration of Bernie Sanders, he's advanced age (old but PC);

when you apply for college, depending on the school, have to honestly fill out the application, certain schools (have you ever been suspended for school, Yes or No, if Yes explain) you check that box you're done; if you do something it's on your permanent record forever; colleges promote ethics, and don't want to admit people who are a `nuisance to society`; has that ever been put on your police file, next to your mugshot?\n- thankfully in America today the government is not controlled by business interests and wealthy people \\\\s\n- group protests and walkouts, March 13, 2020;

I could say something, but I would not, vis a vis, grades (someone saying they've never read it before)\n- angry parents or angry teachers is redundant construction, like oblivious students; it's funny because stereotyping \n- I'm just a simple person, what do I know about math; Macroeconomics should theoretically be easier, also teaching that course, you can do either first, they chose to do theoretically the hardest part first; Macro applies to history first, so I'm biased, not to cause problems\n- Romanovs, new Russian people who moved in town, just like the Medicis who moved in \\\\s;
